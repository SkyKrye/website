      <b><mark>This is the first post, it shared a supposed quote by Ariana Grande that goes "Never hate on someone's
          idol, it could be the only reason they're alive", it followed with an image of all the BTS band members and
          linked her quote to them, it as well as the poster's account has been deleted or terminated, i don't
          know.</mark></b>

        ><b>skykrye</b>:
        @_eternal_btsarmy_ I don't need to hate them, if you used the basic common sense of a 7 year old you'd realize
        that simping for dumb celebrities who don't know how to speak English isn't the best thing to do with your free
        time
        <br><br>
        ><b>bluecherry143</b>:
        @skykrye can you speak marathi? Can you understand it? Do yk how to write marathi?
        <br><br>
        ><b>skykrye</b>:
        @bluecherry143 no what does that have to do with anything?
        <br><br>
        ><b>bluecherry143</b>:
        @skykrye exactly, you can't write nd speak marathi since you hve your own mother tongue, same goes with them,
        they've their language too, they don't use english as much as us but they still give their best nd speak enough
        good, don't teach or criticize others if you can't do the same thing in the first place
        <br><br>
        ><b>skykrye</b>:
        @bluecherry143 i don't speak marathi because i don't know it, then why the fuck are these dumbasses even trying
        to speak in a language they don't even know and end up failing so horribly even a 4 year old cold do better than
        them
        <br><br>
        ><b>bluecherry143</b>:
        @skykrye cuz they hve fans which you don't, you dimass

        @skykrye You replied to most of the comments and gave advice. I must say that we don't need ur advice

        ><b>skykrye</b>:
        @bluecherry143 i don't need fans to assure myself that i'm not a dumbass who's liked by cringey 13 year old
        girls that share the mentality of a sheepy 3 year old

        ><b>5an_girl</b>
        @skykrye u don't know that i was going in depression but they taught me how to be happy. How to find happiness
        in little things
        <br><br>
        <i>NOTE: i cared enough to call him my g and he's still crigne smhmh</i>
        <br><br>
        ><b>skykrye:</b>
        @5an_girl Ok, how does wax figures singing children's songs help you cope with "depression" instead of a
        certified therapist or something?
        <br><br>
        ><b>mintaeee.76</b>
        @skykrye something that ppl or should I say haters like u will never understand.
        <br><br>
        ><b>5an_girl</b>
        @skykrye is there anyone in your life who gives you sukoon
        <br><br>
        ><b>skykrye:</b>
        @5an_girl only Allah
        <br><br>
        ><b>skykrye:</b>
        @5an_girl if you're not into religion then did you forget your family and most importantly your parents? The
        people who sacrificed their lives for a piece of shit like you?
        <br><br>
        ><b>5an_girl</b>
        @skykrye hm. so there is not even single person in your life who gives you sukoon . So u won't understand yar
        <br><br>
        <i>NOTE: "sukoon" is an urdu word meaning peace and relaxation, "yar" is a friendly form of address (according
          to the goofy google).</i>

        @bts__army.2002 your idols are worthless in the end, these pop celebrities don't notice your existence, they
        only refer to you from the point of a figure among the unaware masses. Return to Allah, these idols will be your
        downfall

        ><b>skykrye:</b>
        @bts__army.2002 obviously the people who don't follow random opinions like little sheepy children, aka the 7
        billion people who don't listen to bts, stop acting like it's the cure for cancer or world peace or anything,
        it's just a music band, a horrible one

          A ATTENTION ARMIES Bts is losing their popularity because of our carelessness their songs,videos are not
          getting much views as before and it's because of we are not streaming them anymore. Even the group's who are
          made recently getting more good views than bts. and haters are taking advantage of it while making useless
          edits on them and mocking them. Example: you can see on YouTube that the songs of BTS member's are make
          recently is not getting good views. Do please help BTS armies you are the only on who can help them. They had
          done a lot for us and still doing,so why can't we? Let's go and again give them their real position.
          Spread this message to all your Army friends it's very necessary to prevent them</mark>
