          because my friend asked me to "Write a detailed account on the life of DanTDM up until he died in his hardcore
          world" as a joke.

      v1: so basically a child by the name of üÖ±Ô∏èantdm made a channel back when minceraft was made then he met a goofy
      villager named trayosaurus rex and a skeleton dawg which i forgot the name of, then he did the chernobyl
      experiment with trayosaurias rex's help and it blew up into smithereens like the world's smallest violin and so he
      moved on and started a goofy ahh giggliddy hardcore world then made everything bombastic then i forgot what
      happened next because i was watching the trailer to the sequel of "paint drying for 9 hours" (truly an emotional
      masterpiece), then basically one day a goofy goober vex looked at him funny then killed him and then he died from
      cancer<br><br>
