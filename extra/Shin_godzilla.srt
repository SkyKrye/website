2
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,182
We just spotted a pleasure craft
drifting offshore of Haneda.

3
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,018
Recon and intercept.
Over.

4
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:44,786
Roger that.

5
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,822
We've got the vessel in sight.

6
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:49,057
From here, there's no apparent
hull damage.

7
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,392
She's called "The Glory Maru."

8
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,461
Requesting owner information now.

9
00:00:53,494 --> 00:00:56,531
In the meantime,
we're going aboard.

10
00:00:56,564 --> 00:00:58,433
We're now on board.

11
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:03,805
Hello?
Anyone here?

12
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:06,541
There's no one on the flying deck.

13
00:01:06,574 --> 00:01:08,276
No sign of life.

14
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:12,113
Just some personal effects.

15
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:14,249
No traces of an incident.

16
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,784
Maybe a fall overboard?

17
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:21,156
Vessel's vacant.
We'll prepare a tow.

18
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,203
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:36,371
Hey, stop!

20
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,944
Here's all the info
we have so far.

21
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,613
That eruption caused a leak
in the Aqua-Line.

22
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:49,184
As a result, water is pouring
onto the auto lanes.

23
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:51,419
A liaison office has already been set up,

24
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:53,288
and an emergency order issued.

25
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,489
And where's the PM?

26
00:01:54,522 --> 00:01:56,324
He's arriving in 28 minutes.

27
00:01:56,357 --> 00:01:58,026
We'll need intel.
Downstairs.

28
00:01:58,059 --> 00:01:59,560
Right.

29
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:03,098
First report confirmed at about 8:30 am.

30
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:05,166
A leak occurred in the
Tokyo Aqua-Line tunnel

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,368
near the 2.5 kilo marker.

32
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:08,970
Seawater entered from a fissure...

33
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,338
Update me as you get info.

34
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:11,639
Right.

35
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:13,308
damaged by the flood.

36
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,143
Emergency crews are
currently on the scene.

37
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,045
Hamanami Coast Guard efforts are being

38
00:02:17,078 --> 00:02:20,048
stymied by the steam cloud
that's in the bay.

39
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:22,317
The Aqua-Line is still closed both ways,

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,887
and safety alerts have been
issued throughout the region.

41
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:27,889
Status report, Mr. Koriyama?

42
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:29,958
We have a total of
five confirmed collisions

43
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:31,259
in the tunnel so far.

44
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:33,161
Was it an earthquake
that caused the flooding?

45
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,130
We're awaiting the seismic readings.

46
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:37,332
Could it be related to
that strange sea eruption?

47
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,434
We don't know that, not yet at least.

48
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:41,469
We've got aerials!

49
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:47,475
An underwater volcanic eruption, maybe?

50
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:49,444
If so, it's a strange one.

51
00:02:49,477 --> 00:02:51,079
Coast Guard six-nine-one reporting

52
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:53,481
continued steam eruptions in the bay.

53
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:55,283
Undersea visibility is currently zero

54
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:57,685
because of all that churning water.

55
00:02:57,718 --> 00:02:59,554
When the PM arrives, I'm suggesting

56
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:01,522
a unified initial response.

57
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,191
We'll need to reorganize.

58
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,126
FDMA disaster task force

59
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,494
is currently assembling.

60
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,229
Third Regional Coast Guard HQ

61
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:09,965
has sealed the bay.
As of now, there is

62
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:12,167
no sea or air access to the area.

63
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,935
A coastal evacuation advisory

64
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:16,271
has been issued to the public.

65
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:18,139
Attention! Please evacuate

66
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:19,941
the premises immediately!

67
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:22,343
For your safety, please
follow police instructions

68
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:24,579
and evacuate to Kisarazu!

69
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:26,114
What's happening?
Is someone hurt?

70
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:29,250
This way, and watch your head!

71
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:30,952
Cool, a slide!

72
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:33,721
Stay calm.

73
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:35,256
Heading to first aid.

74
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,691
This place is awesome!

75
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:38,726
Ow, my feet hurt!

76
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,628
You know, I bet I can sell this footage

77
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:42,163
to the news.

78
00:03:43,698 --> 00:03:45,166
What was that noise?

79
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,534
C'mon, let's go.

80
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:48,136
Something's up there.

81
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,369
Please stay calm and seated...

82
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,571
This is bad.

83
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,207
Look, this is starting to freak me out.

84
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,608
Hey, what's that?

85
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:55,310
What? Wh-Where?

86
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:58,113
I see it, too.

87
00:03:58,146 --> 00:03:59,747
Sir, the PM's arrived.

88
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,460
We haven't been able
to ascertain the cause

89
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:03,084
of the tunnel rupture yet.

90
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,552
Never mind the details.

91
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,387
How many fatalities have there been?

92
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:07,455
- None.
- Then things

93
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:09,257
aren't as bad as they could be.

94
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,492
Still, there's
a secondary disaster risk.

95
00:04:11,526 --> 00:04:13,461
I've cleared your schedule
so that you can attend

96
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:15,596
an emergency meeting
in five minutes, sir.

97
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,365
Well then, let's get there.

98
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:20,135
Obviously, some type of
undersea thermal discharge

99
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:23,071
has occurred, but do we have
any ideas as to its cause?

100
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:24,439
The meltdown of an unidentified

101
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,107
nuclear submarine perhaps?

102
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,109
There's no way.
The bay's too shallow

103
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,245
for a sub so that would be impossible.

104
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:33,148
We believe the fissure was
created by magma steam.

105
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:36,051
Something that was released
by a new undersea volcano.

106
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:38,253
Um. Excuse me, sir.

107
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:41,056
While we did initially believe
that, further study has shown

108
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:43,224
the epicenter to be
shallow and just steam,

109
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:46,061
so we're now confident that
it's not volcanic activity.

110
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:48,163
You should have shared
that info with me sooner!

111
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:49,330
Sorry, sir.

112
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:51,132
Another idea forwarded is a new,

113
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,633
large hydrothermal vent.

114
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,568
Yeah, that must be it.

115
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:56,304
Come on. A vent
directly above the tunnel?

116
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,274
Past geological surveys would
have uncovered it years ago.

117
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:01,209
Well, maybe it was simply overlooked.

118
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:05,513
The cause... is something
on the sea floor.

119
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:07,348
Something, eh? Like what?

120
00:05:07,382 --> 00:05:09,084
A colossal creature, sir.

121
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:10,785
There's some footage of it online.

122
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:13,088
That's absurd.
People probably just saw

123
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:14,222
a big whale spouting.

124
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:15,323
The sea is boiling.

125
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,658
No living creature could
survive those temperatures.

126
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,695
We've been scouring online
videos, Prime Minister,

127
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:23,098
but we've yet to find
any conclusive evidence

128
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:24,365
of the flooding's cause.

129
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,534
Look, time's a wasting here, people.

130
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:28,536
How about a process of elimination?

131
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:31,106
I agree. The cause is a new volcano,

132
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,275
or a large thermal vent.
It can't be anything else.

133
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:36,177
Then we need to plan
our general response,

134
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,346
ladies and gentleman.
Therefore I suggest holding

135
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,216
a cabinet meeting immediately.
Prime Minister?

136
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:43,451
Yes. Good idea.

137
00:05:43,484 --> 00:05:46,254
In that case, let's move
to the main conference room.

138
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:54,462
We have to stay
on top of this situation.

139
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:57,365
Yaguchi.

140
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,118
Listen, you're going
to have to toe the line

141
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:02,637
on their decision.
Don't stir things up, okay?

142
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,440
I just think that we should
consider every possibility.

143
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:07,675
You're a rebel. That's good,

144
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,345
but the guy who got you here isn't one.

145
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:13,681
Got it? Take my advice.

146
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:20,787
I'm happy to report
that all those injured

147
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:22,623
in the tunnel are receiving care.

148
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:24,659
In order to prevent
any further accidents,

149
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:27,528
fireboats and helicopters have
been mobilized in the bay.

150
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:29,864
They stand ready to respond. Who's next?

151
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:32,633
I am. Regarding the
Tokyo Bay coastal region,

152
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:35,603
we're currently at evacuation
preparedness level one.

153
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:38,706
Due to possible debris and ash
from the previous incident

154
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:41,242
and any potential future ones,
we're considering

155
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,845
the possibility of grounding
all flights out of Haneda.

156
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:52,153
Please forgive me.
I was just handed a correction.

157
00:06:52,187 --> 00:06:54,289
It's been decided to
definitely ground all flights

158
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:56,624
out of Haneda to ensure citizen safety.

159
00:06:56,657 --> 00:07:00,428
No flights will be going in
or out until further notice.

160
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:03,698
In regards to
the undersea volcano-induced

161
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:05,700
flooding of the Aqua-Line Tunnel,

162
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:08,336
it's fortunate that
no toxic gases whatsoever

163
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:09,904
have been detected thus far.

164
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:13,274
A team from the Meteorological
Agency has been mobilized.

165
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,476
As has a group of experts
from the Coast Guard.

166
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,445
And both are now currently
on route to conduct

167
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,348
a thorough investigation of the cause.

168
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,222
Everyone. I've been notified
that eruption activity

169
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:29,257
is dying down rapidly!

170
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,292
Huh?

171
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:36,531
Is it over?

172
00:07:36,564 --> 00:07:38,466
No big deal, I guess.

173
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,402
Sir. With all due respect,

174
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:45,673
I must reiterate the presence
of a large marine creature...

175
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:46,974
as a possible cause.

176
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:50,311
Yaguchi, this is a serious
matter. Not some joke.

177
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,647
I agree. This is a ministerial
meeting after all.

178
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,515
Don't make a mockery of it.

179
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:05,460
And with no time frame for restoration,

180
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:06,827
we can expect...

181
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,729
Sir? There's been another incident.

182
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:10,698
Turn on the TV.

183
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:13,434
Sorry! But we have
to suspend this meeting!

184
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:16,203
The TV! Turn it on now!

185
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:18,739
It's unbelievable! Look at

186
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:21,242
the size of it! I...
and I doubt anyone else...

187
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:24,011
has ever seen anything like it before!

188
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:25,746
A few minutes ago, this strange...

189
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,415
Wh-What is that thing?

190
00:08:27,448 --> 00:08:29,550
- A tail?
- It appears so.

191
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:30,951
I guess Yaguchi's "joke"

192
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:33,854
is no laughing matter after all, huh?

193
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,557
This meeting's adjourned!
All cabinet heads, please,

194
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:39,394
let's assemble in the Prime
Minister's office right away!

195
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:41,396
Eyewitness News chopper just...

196
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:46,567
So what is this thing?

197
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:48,836
"Giant Unidentified Lifeform," sir.

198
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:51,639
That's what we're calling it
for now. But, um...

199
00:08:51,672 --> 00:08:53,741
That name, it will
more than likely change

200
00:08:53,774 --> 00:08:55,376
since we're currently
compiling a list of

201
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,678
leading biologists and
scientists to consult with

202
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:59,514
on the subject. Once done,
they'll come here

203
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:01,616
for an emergency meeting
to ascertain what this

204
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,284
thing is and what we should call it.

205
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:05,286
We need to know now!
Get them here!

206
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,054
- Right!
- Sir.

207
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:08,956
Until these folks arrive,
we should focus on

208
00:09:08,989 --> 00:09:11,326
something else. Our response.

209
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:12,427
Yes, of course.

210
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,363
How do we respond to
something that's unprecedented?

211
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:18,032
I think that the choices are
obviously quite simple.

212
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:19,934
We can do nothing and just let it go,

213
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:22,002
or capture it, try to exterminate it,

214
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:24,539
or possibly even
attempt to chase it off.

215
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:26,741
I vote for extermination.

216
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,044
And I concur. Look at
the costs incurred already

217
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:32,913
with the tunnel, and the
Haneda flight groundings.

218
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,450
Plus, if Tokyo Bay remains
closed indefinitely,

219
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:37,818
those costs are going
to skyrocket, gentlemen.

220
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:40,355
I agree, and vote to exterminate it.

221
00:09:40,388 --> 00:09:42,457
Me, too. The sooner, the better.

222
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,692
And you? Defense?

223
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:46,994
Eeh...

224
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:48,863
While it's true that we have prepared

225
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,699
for a wildlife-based threat
before, it was never with

226
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:54,502
self-defense forces
using weapons in the bay.

227
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:55,803
I vote no.

228
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:57,838
Well, in that case, why blow it up?

229
00:09:57,872 --> 00:09:59,407
Can't we chase it off?

230
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,608
If I may.

231
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,977
We might want to factor in the
public's opinion, as well.

232
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,045
So, you know, academics
and environmentalists

233
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:06,947
are raising a stink
and they're calling for

234
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,417
its live capture as a new species.

235
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,918
No, let's kill it.

236
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:12,787
A few torpedoes won't hurt the bay.

237
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,555
The use of weapons actually could,

238
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:17,692
and that's why I'm advocating
for a live capture instead.

239
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:19,894
I do as well.
I think capturing the thing

240
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:22,363
is our best option at this point.

241
00:10:22,397 --> 00:10:24,865
Go gather all the intel
you can on the lifeform.

242
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,801
And the options for
extermination, capture,

243
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,404
and expulsion and what
those things might require.

244
00:10:29,437 --> 00:10:32,873
Seems like they're evenly
divided, aren't they?

245
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:34,942
Sorry, who are you addressing?

246
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,114
A vapor cloud's been spotted moving

247
00:10:41,115 --> 00:10:42,783
near the Tama River!

248
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:44,952
What? "Moving"?

249
00:10:44,985 --> 00:10:46,987
It's alive, isn't it?

250
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,157
The creature's just off of
Haneda Airport, near Runway D,

251
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,760
and it appears to be
entering the Tama River.

252
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:54,595
Whoa!

253
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,897
We just got a report from
the Bayshore Expressway!

254
00:10:56,931 --> 00:10:57,832
It's flooding!

255
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,400
Damn, not again!

256
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:00,835
Forget capturing it.

257
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,770
Sir. Three experts have arrived.

258
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:05,506
I suggest we go consult
with them right now.

259
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,619
From the TV images, it's indiscernible

260
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:21,188
whether this thing could
possibly be a relic dinosaur

261
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:24,959
or some undiscovered whale species.

262
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:27,595
In my opinion,
the creature is a heretofore

263
00:11:27,628 --> 00:11:30,064
unknown aquatic species.

264
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:34,134
But I can't say for certain
without an examination.

265
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:37,204
Since I don't know if
this footage is legitimate,

266
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:42,677
I cannot say. If I comment
on unverified evidence...

267
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,614
I could lose my
credibility as a biologist.

268
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:51,486
It's wrapping up.
We'll resume shortly.

269
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,921
Can't be good if it's already over.

270
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:16,844
Sorry to say, but that was
a huge waste of time.

271
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:17,945
I agree, sir.

272
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:19,480
Those experts were useless.

273
00:12:19,514 --> 00:12:21,148
Get me some people who know something.

274
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:22,717
On it, sir.

275
00:12:26,186 --> 00:12:28,623
Shimura. Any ideas?

276
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:29,856
Well, I do have a college friend

277
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:33,060
who's with the Environment
Ministry, but she's low-ranking.

278
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:34,929
That's okay, call her now.

279
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,139
This creature...
it appears to be serpentine

280
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:48,275
with auxiliary ambulation, and
even though it possesses gills,

281
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:51,211
it also has legs
just like a lungfish does.

282
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:55,282
Huh. If it has legs
then can it come on land?

283
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:57,718
Yes, it's a possibility.

284
00:12:57,752 --> 00:12:59,887
If it does, who stops it?

285
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,856
Well, frankly, we haven't
determined which agency

286
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,958
it falls under yet, sir.

287
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,193
Um, one of our scientists
is of the belief

288
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:08,529
that the creature's fin-like
feet would more than likely

289
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:10,898
be crushed by the immense
weight of its own body.

290
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,232
So it coming ashore should be

291
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:13,968
physiologically impossible.

292
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,301
We can't be sure of that since we're

293
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:17,071
dealing with an unknown animal.

294
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:20,007
Is that so? Do you
share this view as well?

295
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:24,945
I apologize for the deputy
chief's lack of decorum, sir,

296
00:13:24,979 --> 00:13:27,047
but just as your experts
have already concluded,

297
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:30,317
I believe the creature coming
on land is quite improbable.

298
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,952
I see.

299
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:35,623
Sir. Regarding the
damage to the tunnels...

300
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:37,625
I'd like to humbly suggest
that the sooner we hold

301
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:40,995
an official press conference to
calm the public, the better.

302
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,097
But sir, I must stress this,

303
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,232
please be careful that you
only give out information

304
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:47,201
that's been verified thus far.

305
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:50,070
Let's do this.

306
00:13:50,104 --> 00:13:52,239
Please get my uniform ready.

307
00:14:12,927 --> 00:14:14,128
Earlier in the day,

308
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:16,296
both the Aqua-Line
and Tama River tunnels

309
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,699
sustained significant damage.

310
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,868
We're currently tracking
the creature responsible

311
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,003
as it moves up the Nomi River.

312
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:24,839
We've yet to positively
identify what sort of

313
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:26,974
animal it is, but we don't believe

314
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:28,876
that it can come on land.

315
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,978
Even though it's unlikely,
should it beach itself

316
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:33,948
in the bay's shallows
there is no need to fear.

317
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:37,051
Our experts believe its own
weight would crush it to death.

318
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,086
I repeat, there is no danger

319
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,955
of the creature coming ashore.

320
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:42,690
So please set your minds at ease.

321
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:44,291
Thank you. That will be all.

322
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:46,927
Sir, sorry to interrupt.

323
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,098
What? It has?

324
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:10,685
Well, well. No danger
of coming ashore, huh?

325
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:13,387
Well, now what? I was
just proven a liar on TV!

326
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,222
But sir, like Akasaka said,

327
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:17,291
you were only supposed
to give verified info!

328
00:15:17,324 --> 00:15:18,893
I wanted to reassure the public.

329
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:20,227
How's that thing ashore?

330
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,362
We don't know.
We've posed that question

331
00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:24,298
to our experts and
are waiting to hear back.

332
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:26,667
To hell with them.
We have to act.

333
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:50,057
Sir. We need to set up emergency

334
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,459
disaster control headquarters now.

335
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:53,627
Then do it.

336
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,163
This cabinet council
meeting is now adjourned.

337
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:58,065
Let's get to work.

338
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,369
There's so much bureaucracy involved.

339
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:04,238
Every action requires a meeting.

340
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:06,106
Come on, don't knock red tape.

341
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,908
It's the foundation of democracy.

342
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:09,108
Why does there have to be so much

343
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:10,911
for a press conference?

344
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:12,311
In the last few hours, we have set up

345
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:14,815
emergency disaster control headquarters.

346
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,885
Its sole purpose is to combat
the Giant Unidentified Lifeform

347
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:19,720
that has come ashore.

348
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:21,922
We are crafting a full-scale response

349
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:24,291
to secure citizen safety,
and that includes

350
00:16:24,324 --> 00:16:26,761
coordinated evacuation with both Tokyo

351
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:28,763
and federal government agencies.

352
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:30,965
Evacuation instructions
will be issued shortly

353
00:16:30,998 --> 00:16:33,433
for areas along the creature's path.

354
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:41,875
The creature is currently headed

355
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,011
towards Shinagawa.
We're clocking it at a speed of

356
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,313
about 13 kilometers an hour.

357
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:49,049
For something so big,
it moves quite slowly.

358
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,118
But it could still
reach Tokyo in three hours

359
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:52,787
- at that pace.
- Just imagine what

360
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,488
that thing could do to this city.

361
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:57,324
Good God. The damage here
would be catastrophic.

362
00:16:57,357 --> 00:16:59,326
Let's exterminate this thing right now!

363
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:01,261
Not in densely-populated areas!

364
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:03,831
We have to evacuate the citizens first.

365
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:08,836
Have MIC and MLIT set up
evacuation zones and transport.

366
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,072
The PM's ordered us to conduct

367
00:17:12,106 --> 00:17:15,309
evacuation measures!
Report to your stations!

368
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:17,262
I thought the orders
would have come much sooner.

369
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:18,311
I can't say I'm surprised.

370
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:21,015
The First Reponses manual
doesn't cover this.

371
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:23,183
An evacuation due to a monster.

372
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:25,119
What's more, an expedited one.

373
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:26,452
We've never even drilled for this type

374
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:28,288
of action before, sir.

375
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:31,125
Plus, a city-wide evacuation
will more than likely

376
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:32,526
cause a general panic.

377
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,328
There'll be mass gridlock with everyone

378
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:36,063
trying to leave the city.

379
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,898
In that case, we'll make every effort

380
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,466
to control the traffic.

381
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:40,968
Traffic signals are out of order.

382
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,303
For your safety,
please leave your vehicles

383
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:47,074
and follow police and safety
personnel instructions.

384
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,009
Attention! Attention!

385
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:53,247
A full evacuation of
Shinagawa has been issued.

386
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,082
All residents are required to evacuate

387
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,251
the area immediately.

388
00:18:17,872 --> 00:18:19,940
Hon! Hurry!

389
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:40,928
At this rate the city'll be in ruins.

390
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:44,564
Contact Public Safety.
Get them on the horn now.

391
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:46,500
Tell them we're requesting
Self-Defense Forces

392
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,402
to come exterminate that thing.

393
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:50,404
So they want to use weapons?

394
00:18:50,437 --> 00:18:53,273
Correct. Article 76
says in an armed attack,

395
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:55,876
Self-Defense troops
are allowed to use force.

396
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,178
But this doesn't
qualify as an armed attack.

397
00:18:58,212 --> 00:19:00,580
And to be accurate,
Article 76 stipulates

398
00:19:00,614 --> 00:19:03,150
"by an aggressor country
or equivalent force."

399
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,318
Not some monster.

400
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,887
We don't have time
to argue over semantics.

401
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:09,156
Only the SDF is equipped to respond.

402
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,960
This request, it means soldiers
engaging in urban combat.

403
00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:13,960
That's certainly going to give

404
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:17,231
the Prime Minister pause.

405
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:18,598
All due respect,

406
00:19:18,632 --> 00:19:21,001
but we need a response with
a two-pronged approach.

407
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,570
Military force and citizen evacuation.

408
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:26,306
I also urge you to declare
a state of emergency.

409
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,642
Right now, it appears
that we have only one option,

410
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,912
and that's mobilization
for defense, of course.

411
00:19:31,946 --> 00:19:35,215
But we can only do that
on your orders, sir.

412
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:39,954
You're talking about a
declaration with no precedent.

413
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:43,523
We'd be... mobilizing
the country for war.

414
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,559
What's more, the police are still

415
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:48,095
evacuating thousands of people.

416
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:51,065
If we launch a military strike,
there is a high likelihood

417
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:53,633
of collateral damage
in terms of casualties.

418
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,235
I don't want that.

419
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:56,937
The US forces that are here.

420
00:19:56,971 --> 00:20:00,074
Can't we get them to kill this
beast under the Security Treaty?

421
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:03,410
No, our government and SDF,
we have to move first here.

422
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:07,381
Even under the Treaty, the US
can only provide support.

423
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,616
We're facing a living organism.

424
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:11,685
And an unknown one, so aggravating it

425
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:13,320
might lead to more damage.

426
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:15,189
It is an organism.

427
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:18,058
And that means, we can stop
the thing in its tracks.

428
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,060
And unlike an earthquake or a typhoon,

429
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,561
we can halt its progress.

430
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,398
Lives, sir. That should
be our top priority.

431
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,167
Sir, I know this must
be a difficult decision,

432
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:29,503
but to prevent further calamity

433
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:32,139
your authorization is needed now.

434
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:35,309
Wait, right this instant?
You're serious?

435
00:20:35,342 --> 00:20:37,511
Time is wasting. Your answer.

436
00:20:37,544 --> 00:20:39,379
Moments ago, the Prime Minister declared

437
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:41,248
a national state
of emergency in response

438
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,550
to the giant creature
that has come ashore.

439
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,752
He's also called for
the first-ever mobilization

440
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:49,423
of Self-Defense Forces
in this nation's history.

441
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,992
This makes it Japan's
first military action

442
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:54,628
since World War II, and when
asked for justification,

443
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:58,465
the Prime Minister referenced
the terminology in Article 76.

444
00:20:58,498 --> 00:21:00,134
Nerima 1st Division was dispatched

445
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:01,768
at Tokyo's request.

446
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:03,503
While this group has been tasked with

447
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:06,340
guiding both rescue
and evacuation efforts,

448
00:21:06,373 --> 00:21:09,243
I must stress that they are
not equipped for battle.

449
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:12,546
I'd say attack helicopters
would be our best defense.

450
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:14,514
- Contact Kisarazu Base.
- Sir!

451
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:16,583
Shall we deploy F-2s from Misawa Base?

452
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:19,253
No. Any civilian
casualties could destroy

453
00:21:19,286 --> 00:21:22,522
the SDF forever.
So let's minimize firepower.

454
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:24,624
But we still don't know
this thing's strength.

455
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,494
I think we need to be prepared
for anything in this case.

456
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:30,364
I agree. That's why
I'm going to recommend

457
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:32,666
an integrated, three-force operation.

458
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:35,269
Call the PM.

459
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:37,171
According to this plan, the joint force

460
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:39,173
will be led by the Eastern Army.

461
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:41,108
The goal is extermination.

462
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:42,176
The ground troops.

463
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:44,778
They'll continue to evacuate
all of the citizens.

464
00:21:44,811 --> 00:21:45,979
With your permission,

465
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:49,416
our rapid response helicopters
will attack the creature.

466
00:21:49,449 --> 00:21:52,252
Sir, it's very likely that some elderly

467
00:21:52,286 --> 00:21:54,721
and infirm people might
still remain in the city.

468
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:56,190
That's why I can't make a decision

469
00:21:56,223 --> 00:21:58,125
without an inspection first.

470
00:21:58,158 --> 00:22:00,194
Unfortunately, under
conditions like these,

471
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:03,497
I'd say some collateral damage
is unavoidable now.

472
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,767
Sir, I know this isn't easy for you,

473
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:11,605
but we need a decision.

474
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:12,806
Understood.

475
00:22:16,676 --> 00:22:17,676
This is a risky mission against

476
00:22:17,677 --> 00:22:20,814
an unknown enemy.
Did this group volunteer?

477
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:22,682
No, standard rotation.

478
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,285
They said this is what
they signed up for, sir.

479
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,155
Pilots! Good luck!

480
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:30,324
Lifting off from Kisarazu at 13:08.

481
00:22:30,357 --> 00:22:32,592
ETA 13:20, over.

482
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:41,368
What a relief this is.
That thing will be dead soon.

483
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,570
I'm sure the choppers
will make short work of it.

484
00:22:43,603 --> 00:22:45,639
Yeah. I bet we could turn its carcass

485
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:47,774
into a big tourist attraction.

486
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:50,510
Sirs. Just as a reminder,

487
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:53,313
the Old Imperial Army thought like that.

488
00:22:53,347 --> 00:22:55,649
During the last war,
their armchair theories

489
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:58,452
led to the loss of three
million Japanese lives.

490
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:00,687
So beware of unfounded optimism.

491
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:16,203
Please watch your step!

492
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:17,471
Remain calm!

493
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,873
This way, please!
Pick up the pace!

494
00:23:19,906 --> 00:23:22,542
Local evacuation centers are useless!

495
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:25,679
Tell us where to send
these people! Hurry!

496
00:23:48,235 --> 00:23:49,636
The creature's progression!

497
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:51,705
Somehow it's suddenly stopped!

498
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:55,309
Stopped? But why now?

499
00:24:25,472 --> 00:24:28,975
Look.

500
00:24:29,008 --> 00:24:30,810
It's evolving.

501
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,696
Attacker 1, this is CP, over.

502
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,564
Copy that, CP, over.

503
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:28,268
Head to holding area 2
to await further orders. Over.

504
00:25:28,302 --> 00:25:30,370
Attacker 1. Copy.

505
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:39,979
It's not like we were told.

506
00:25:40,013 --> 00:25:41,247
CP, it's Attacker 1.

507
00:25:41,281 --> 00:25:45,285
Target differs from report, and
that thing is much bigger now.

508
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,853
Attacker 1.
Hold your position

509
00:25:46,886 --> 00:25:49,255
and await further instructions. Over.

510
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:51,791
I was just informed that resident

511
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:53,493
evacuation is complete.

512
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:57,464
Excellent. Minister,
we're now ready to open fire.

513
00:25:57,497 --> 00:25:58,798
Understood.

514
00:25:58,832 --> 00:26:01,568
Well, sir, we'll fire at your command.

515
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,503
Say the word.

516
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:06,506
Very well. Fire.

517
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,842
Attacker 1, you have
a greenlight from the PM.

518
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,410
Commence fire on the creature.

519
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,713
I repeat, commence fire. Over.

520
00:26:13,747 --> 00:26:16,650
Copy that, CP.
Commencing fire.

521
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:17,984
Target in sight.

522
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:19,919
Aim straight for the head.

523
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,556
Ready. Aim.

524
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:24,758
Wait, hold your fire!

525
00:26:36,503 --> 00:26:37,971
Why aren't they firing?

526
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:41,675
We just spotted a few civilians
near the line of fire!

527
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,643
Civies present. Can we fire?

528
00:26:43,677 --> 00:26:45,679
Can we fire if civilians are present?

529
00:26:45,712 --> 00:26:48,348
So do we wait?
Or do we fire?

530
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:51,718
Civilians present.
So do we proceed or abort?

531
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:55,622
Sir. Your answer. We need it!

532
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,591
Now, sir!

533
00:26:57,624 --> 00:27:00,394
Abort. Call it off.

534
00:27:00,427 --> 00:27:03,463
Do it now.
We must protect civilians!

535
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:07,000
Attacker 1, abort and move
to holding positions. Over.

536
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:09,736
Copy that CP. Over.

537
00:27:27,053 --> 00:27:28,020
The creature is currently

538
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,689
on the move again.

539
00:27:29,723 --> 00:27:31,089
It's breaking through the expressway

540
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,993
and appears to be headed
towards Tokyo Bay.

541
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:49,409
All flights out of Narita

542
00:27:49,443 --> 00:27:50,910
have been canceled.

543
00:27:50,944 --> 00:27:52,177
We have several reports of fires

544
00:27:52,178 --> 00:27:53,813
blazing out of control...

545
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:55,213
The Transit Authority verified that...

546
00:27:55,214 --> 00:27:56,916
Meanwhile, pledges of support

547
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,051
continue to pour in from...

548
00:27:58,084 --> 00:27:59,619
and more supplies and aid workers

549
00:27:59,653 --> 00:28:01,119
are said to be on their way here now.

550
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,089
The Tokyo Stock Exchange will be

551
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:04,891
open as usual today.

552
00:28:04,924 --> 00:28:06,693
Barring any unforeseen events,

553
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,595
the bullet-train is
operating shuttle service

554
00:28:08,628 --> 00:28:09,696
from Shin-Yokohama.

555
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,197
Scientific envoys from France

556
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,833
and other nations
have arrived in an attempt

557
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:15,568
to help the government
ascertain the exact nature...

558
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:16,736
so the search zone is

559
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,138
being expanded to cover a
much wider area. Officials...

560
00:28:19,172 --> 00:28:20,807
bringing the total number

561
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,976
of confirmed casualties
to 100 at this hour,

562
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:24,878
but rescue personnel are still...

563
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,780
reportedly been put out.

564
00:28:26,813 --> 00:28:28,547
While government officials
search for the creature,

565
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:30,450
Disaster Management Minister Kanai

566
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:32,486
is leading an envoy to survey and assess

567
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,554
the damage that it's caused.

568
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:42,095
It was ashore for what, maybe two hours?

569
00:28:42,128 --> 00:28:44,531
And it did all this?

570
00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:49,769
No. We did wasting time
with our response.

571
00:28:49,803 --> 00:28:51,505
It's our fault.

572
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:55,074
We didn't know what it
could do. It surprised us.

573
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,812
Everyone did their best
in the circumstances.

574
00:28:58,845 --> 00:29:00,780
So don't be so damn smug.

575
00:29:00,814 --> 00:29:02,882
It's time to speak to the press,
Minister Kanai.

576
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:04,684
This way, please.

577
00:29:04,718 --> 00:29:07,787
Okay.

578
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:36,982
We've arrived at the coordinates

579
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,918
that you requested, Captain.

580
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:41,755
Full stop, begin scanning operation.

581
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:49,261
We believe the creature more than likely

582
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:52,532
submerged itself somewhere
on the seafloor off Kanaya.

583
00:29:52,566 --> 00:29:54,634
So then, we've stepped up patrols

584
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,770
and strengthened our
surveillance around Chiba

585
00:29:56,803 --> 00:29:58,237
and Sagami Bay as well.

586
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:00,940
But if that thing's hiding
somewhere in the Sagami Trough,

587
00:30:00,974 --> 00:30:02,776
detection's a moot point.

588
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:04,578
Who knows when or where than damn thing

589
00:30:04,611 --> 00:30:06,846
will emerge next?

590
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,683
How are the preparations coming along?

591
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,120
A rapid land strategy at
water's edge won't be easy.

592
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:15,855
I suggest multiple plans.

593
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:17,757
I agree, so get to work devising them.

594
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:19,726
I want to see numerous ones
for a landing point

595
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,895
encounter and expeditionary pursuit.

596
00:30:21,928 --> 00:30:23,863
- Right.
- Sir. I'll get on them.

597
00:30:23,897 --> 00:30:25,931
And they will include a number
of different artillery,

598
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:28,134
tank, and F-2 scenarios.

599
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:30,103
Well, well.

600
00:30:30,136 --> 00:30:32,706
Defensive operations
lean heavily on Kanto.

601
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:35,308
I knew the metro area
would take top priority.

602
00:30:35,341 --> 00:30:38,144
Yep. Sounds like a fifth floor order.

603
00:30:38,177 --> 00:30:40,680
But why Kanto and not the other regions?

604
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,682
Well, you see, in regards
to the other regions...

605
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,684
at least in terms of the GNP...

606
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:47,654
they make up 17% of the total.

607
00:30:47,687 --> 00:30:49,656
But Kanto, on the
other hand, it makes up

608
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:52,191
a whopping 40% of it.

609
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,727
Gotta admit that sounds like

610
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,030
a real prudent strategy to me.

611
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,132
I'd hate to make that decision.

612
00:30:59,165 --> 00:31:01,000
That's right, and in fact,
they've even set up

613
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:03,670
a special response team
in the PM residence.

614
00:31:03,703 --> 00:31:05,805
You don't say.
I also heard you were

615
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,641
appointed its bureau chief.

616
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:09,809
Well, look at you.
You're big time.

617
00:31:09,843 --> 00:31:12,712
But I still need you to pick the team.

618
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,180
Can you do that for me?

619
00:31:14,213 --> 00:31:15,381
'Course I can.

620
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:18,017
I'll bring you people who'll
speak their minds to the PM.

621
00:31:18,051 --> 00:31:20,253
Good. I'll need them.

622
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:22,221
- I'm Tachikawa.
- I'm Takeo.

623
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,658
Ready, lift.

624
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:39,072
My name's Rando Yaguchi.

625
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,305
Thank you all for coming here.

626
00:31:40,306 --> 00:31:42,308
This operation'll be an informal one.

627
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:44,911
Titles and seniority
don't mean anything here

628
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,746
and you can speak freely.

629
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,814
Well, that's it.

630
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:50,149
I'm nominally in charge,
and we're relying on you,

631
00:31:50,183 --> 00:31:52,752
a crack team of lone wolves,
nerds, troublemakers,

632
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,387
academic heretics, freaks, and general

633
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,656
pains-in-the-butt-of-the-bureaucracy.

634
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,192
We need your expertise.
So let's have it.

635
00:31:59,225 --> 00:32:01,661
Here are the basic specs
we have on the creature,

636
00:32:01,695 --> 00:32:03,930
so find out what you can.

637
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,370
- Is this all?
- Yeah, that's all.

638
00:32:11,404 --> 00:32:13,707
We have to fill in
the blanks for the rest.

639
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,875
If you have any info
whatsoever, share it.

640
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:18,244
Yes, since yesterday's
so-called "experts,"

641
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:20,246
they were too baffled
to conclude anything,

642
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,048
and then people died as a result.

643
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:24,317
This is a simple profile I put together.

644
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,986
It shows the three mutations
we've seen so far.

645
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,454
I believe that more are coming.

646
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:30,724
What is this thing?

647
00:32:30,757 --> 00:32:33,159
Um, well. We're analyzing a sample of

648
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:35,028
its body fluid at our lab to find out.

649
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:36,328
If you pass some samples onto me,

650
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,931
I can get us outside help.

651
00:32:37,964 --> 00:32:39,365
Yeah, I'd love to do that,

652
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:41,167
but the US took everything we had left.

653
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,301
As for the on-site remains,

654
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,971
they're currently being burned
because of the stench.

655
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,239
Yeah, I heard.

656
00:32:46,272 --> 00:32:48,174
And at the insistence of the Americans.

657
00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:50,343
Then we leave the analysis to you.

658
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:53,046
Okay, what about its behavioral biology?

659
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:56,282
Well, behaviorally, all that
it's done so far is move,

660
00:32:56,315 --> 00:32:57,984
so we can't determine intellect.

661
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,318
Based on that fact, I think that

662
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,387
communication with it is unlikely.

663
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,422
One simple question.

664
00:33:03,456 --> 00:33:05,358
What's this thing's energy source?

665
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:08,227
It's big. So huge that
it would need an enormous

666
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:09,896
amount of energy not just to move,

667
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:12,031
but also metabolically.

668
00:33:12,065 --> 00:33:14,067
But at that size,
oxygen conversion in its

669
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,069
digestive tract just wouldn't be enough.

670
00:33:16,102 --> 00:33:18,404
Maybe the answer...

671
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:23,376
is nuclear fission?

672
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:27,313
Sense of humor, Miss Ogashira?

673
00:33:27,346 --> 00:33:29,749
That's impossible.

674
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:34,120
A US carrier is leaving port?

675
00:33:34,153 --> 00:33:36,522
Correct. We heard that Yokosuka City's

676
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:39,759
radiation monitoring alert went
off and that could be why.

677
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:40,760
Let me check.

678
00:33:40,794 --> 00:33:42,962
I'll call the Nuclear
Regulation Authority.

679
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:45,498
I have orders not to
go public about this just yet,

680
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:47,433
but radiation levels in the metro area

681
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:49,368
have risen in the last day.

682
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,370
Could this be caused
by a leak somewhere?

683
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,939
Have you checked?

684
00:33:52,972 --> 00:33:55,775
Yes. My team's inspected
all of the nation's reactors

685
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,476
and didn't find a leak at any of them.

686
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,979
Then where's it coming from?

687
00:34:05,018 --> 00:34:06,219
Is this even possible?

688
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,988
What?

689
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:10,423
Quick! Here, look at this!

690
00:34:10,456 --> 00:34:12,225
This data shows
radiation spikes that match

691
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,828
the path the creature took.

692
00:34:17,296 --> 00:34:19,999
Look at this!

693
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:21,901
See?

694
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:27,506
Miss Ogashira was right after all.

695
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,810
Sorry.

696
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:42,588
This information has
apparently already gone viral.

697
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:46,392
That isn't good. Contact the
Chief Cabinet Secretary.

698
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,396
This will be trouble.

699
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:53,366
The PM needs to call a press
conference right away, sir.

700
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,334
Actually, I think we should hold off.

701
00:34:55,368 --> 00:34:58,371
Unless you can absolutely prove
that the creature's radioactive,

702
00:34:58,404 --> 00:35:00,439
this could set off a huge wave of panic.

703
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,342
And it's not enough of a spike
to warrant evacuation.

704
00:35:03,376 --> 00:35:06,145
We also don't have any legal
grounds to implement one.

705
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:09,348
But still, we are dealing
with elevated radiation.

706
00:35:09,382 --> 00:35:10,984
Please remember that.

707
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:17,156
You're right. We can't wait.
I'll talk to the PM.

708
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,157
You there.

709
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:21,060
Schedule a briefing with
the PM in five minutes.

710
00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:23,062
Yes. President Ross.

711
00:35:23,096 --> 00:35:26,132
I understand. Thank you.

712
00:35:28,902 --> 00:35:31,504
So many unilateral requests.

713
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:35,408
Typically, American.

714
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:37,310
I've got word about
an assistant Deputy Chief

715
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,644
to the US President.

716
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:41,080
They're requesting a secret
meeting with the PM.

717
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:42,515
They move fast, don't they?

718
00:35:42,548 --> 00:35:44,984
Yeah. He just left Yokota Air Base

719
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,020
and is already en route to see the PM.

720
00:35:47,053 --> 00:35:49,588
The Foreign Ministry's
in an uproar, of course.

721
00:35:49,622 --> 00:35:52,058
Oh, and this Deputy Chief's aide.

722
00:35:52,091 --> 00:35:54,560
They made a request and are
coming here to meet with you.

723
00:35:54,593 --> 00:35:57,463
With me? But why?

724
00:35:57,496 --> 00:35:59,065
I need someone within the government

725
00:35:59,098 --> 00:36:00,333
that I can work with.

726
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,969
I'm familiar with your record
and your interesting history,

727
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:05,138
so the most obvious choice is you.

728
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:06,572
Don't you think?

729
00:36:06,605 --> 00:36:09,675
Well. I'm honored, but Hideki Akasaka

730
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:11,510
would be a better choice.

731
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,613
Thanks, but he turned me down already.

732
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:18,417
All I need is a favor
that won't stain my record.

733
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:22,121
I want you to find someone for me.

734
00:36:22,155 --> 00:36:24,490
And who might that be?

735
00:36:24,523 --> 00:36:26,559
A man who foresaw
the coming of that creature

736
00:36:26,592 --> 00:36:29,462
many years before
it ravaged your country.

737
00:36:29,495 --> 00:36:31,264
Are you interested?

738
00:36:31,297 --> 00:36:34,367
We know he landed
at Narita seven days ago.

739
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,202
Goro Maki.

740
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,338
Japanese. Former professor.

741
00:36:39,372 --> 00:36:41,640
I hear that your
intelligence agency is...

742
00:36:41,674 --> 00:36:43,342
First-rate.

743
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:45,511
And what's in it for us?

744
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,715
Give us Goro Maki and we'll give you

745
00:36:49,748 --> 00:36:52,018
all the intel we have on your creature.

746
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:55,421
But listen. Let's keep this
op bilateral, okay?

747
00:36:55,454 --> 00:36:58,557
Just US-Japan. So, win-win.

748
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,994
Understood. Let's get to it.

749
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:02,495
Thank you.

750
00:37:02,528 --> 00:37:05,731
Ugh! I rushed to Yokota
straight from a party

751
00:37:05,764 --> 00:37:08,968
so I didn't have time to change.

752
00:37:09,002 --> 00:37:10,103
Where's a Zara?

753
00:37:10,136 --> 00:37:12,605
Kayoco Anne Patterson.

754
00:37:12,638 --> 00:37:14,473
She's very young.

755
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:17,410
America admirably values
performance over age,

756
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,146
and she's Senator Patterson's daughter.

757
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:23,216
Ah, the same one
behind the Kern Agreement.

758
00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:26,185
Formidable. A mixture of
talent, pedigree,

759
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:28,988
and coattail-riding, huh?

760
00:37:29,022 --> 00:37:32,325
I suspect she's not really your type.

761
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:35,594
Nope. Since she uses
her father's connections

762
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:39,365
in such an unabashed way,
she's the political type.

763
00:37:39,398 --> 00:37:41,400
Like Yaguchi.

764
00:37:43,669 --> 00:37:45,771
A search at a time like this?

765
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:48,274
It's for Rando Yaguchi.

766
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,544
I owe his father a debt, a great one.

767
00:37:51,577 --> 00:37:54,180
Use as many agents as you need.

768
00:37:54,213 --> 00:37:58,584
This is the subject's profile.

769
00:37:58,617 --> 00:38:01,020
A professor who was
expelled from his university

770
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:03,622
and left Japan as a result.

771
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,558
Although a biologist,
he ended up working for

772
00:38:05,591 --> 00:38:09,162
an energy firm in
the US. Interesting guy.

773
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:10,596
Is this a red notice?

774
00:38:10,629 --> 00:38:13,532
No. You just need to locate him.

775
00:38:13,566 --> 00:38:18,104
Once he's found, the NSA
or CIA, they'll move in.

776
00:38:18,137 --> 00:38:19,805
And discreetly, I hear.

777
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:22,041
His last known whereabouts.

778
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:25,078
My grandmother's homeland
certainly works fast.

779
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:26,812
Goro Maki's missing.

780
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:29,282
His boat was found
adrift a few days ago,

781
00:38:29,315 --> 00:38:32,351
but there was no trace of him.

782
00:38:32,385 --> 00:38:35,054
Miss Patterson.

783
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:37,456
Were you only looking for Goro Maki?

784
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:41,094
- Or this as well?
- Yeah, that too.

785
00:38:41,127 --> 00:38:44,497
"Now do as you please.
I did the same."

786
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,433
His last words?

787
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:48,701
Do you want to confirm this?

788
00:38:48,734 --> 00:38:50,736
No need.

789
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:53,672
I trust you. This is in special ink,

790
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:54,773
it can't be copied.

791
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:58,211
I'll just take photos then,
to share with my team.

792
00:39:00,646 --> 00:39:03,549
God... zilla?

793
00:39:03,582 --> 00:39:07,086
That's right.
It's the DOE's code name.

794
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,557
Godzilla. He gave it an English name.

795
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:15,394
Gojira. What's it mean?

796
00:39:15,428 --> 00:39:18,197
I found one link.

797
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,466
On Ohdo island where Maki's from,

798
00:39:20,499 --> 00:39:22,768
Gojira means "god incarnate."

799
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:24,002
A violent one.

800
00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:28,241
That's apparently why he put
"God" in the name he gave it.

801
00:39:28,274 --> 00:39:31,677
In Japanese,
the characters read "Gojira."

802
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,448
"Gojira..." you say?

803
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:37,716
Who cares about its name at this point?

804
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,385
It sounds ridiculous.

805
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,655
It's just as well,
the name originated in the US.

806
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:45,824
At least now we know what
to call it. "Gojira."

807
00:39:45,858 --> 00:39:48,661
Just in, and according
to multiple sources,

808
00:39:48,694 --> 00:39:50,463
in regards to the giant creature,

809
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:52,398
"Gojira" is the unofficial name by which

810
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,867
the government is calling it.

811
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,437
Goro Maki?
An ex-biology professor

812
00:39:58,471 --> 00:40:01,640
at Jonan U, huh?

813
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:04,443
Find out all that
you can about this guy.

814
00:40:04,477 --> 00:40:06,179
Do so and you'll get an exclusive

815
00:40:06,212 --> 00:40:08,281
when the time's right to go to print.

816
00:40:08,314 --> 00:40:12,418
That's a promise.
Hope that's enticing enough.

817
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:16,155
Yep. It sure is.

818
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,561
Sixty years ago.

819
00:40:22,595 --> 00:40:24,563
So this is all about unregulated dumping

820
00:40:24,597 --> 00:40:27,533
of radioactive materials.

821
00:40:31,904 --> 00:40:33,639
Don't tell me.

822
00:40:33,672 --> 00:40:36,442
Gojira fed on these.

823
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:40,413
Yes. That's the DOE's conclusion.

824
00:40:40,446 --> 00:40:42,315
They sent requests
to various institutions

825
00:40:42,348 --> 00:40:45,384
to analyze what exactly had
been held in those containers.

826
00:40:45,418 --> 00:40:47,820
Goro Maki was on staff
at one who responded.

827
00:40:47,853 --> 00:40:49,788
According to him, this thing wasn't just

828
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,724
an ancient species of marine life.

829
00:40:51,757 --> 00:40:54,893
But now, one also surrounded
by radioactive waste.

830
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:56,962
Exposure didn't kill this creature,

831
00:40:56,995 --> 00:41:00,733
but mutated it into
an entirely new lifeform.

832
00:41:00,766 --> 00:41:02,768
And that is his Godzilla theory.

833
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:04,770
But it's continuing
to mutate since its body

834
00:41:04,803 --> 00:41:06,905
lengthened and changed
after it came ashore.

835
00:41:06,939 --> 00:41:09,475
Yes. It can somehow
mutate itself to live

836
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,544
on both land and sea.

837
00:41:11,577 --> 00:41:13,646
I have to admit
its capabilities far surpass

838
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,414
anything I could ever imagine.

839
00:41:15,448 --> 00:41:18,884
This is all the
information at my disposal.

840
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:20,986
What comes next?

841
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:23,356
Personal service.

842
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,330
Oh.

843
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,998
This is what Goro Maki left behind?

844
00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:35,401
Mhmmm.

845
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:38,704
I can't make sense of it.

846
00:41:38,737 --> 00:41:41,374
This thing's not a molecular array,

847
00:41:41,407 --> 00:41:43,342
so how's it relate to Gojira?

848
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,244
Well, perhaps it's an analytical table.

849
00:41:45,278 --> 00:41:46,845
One with structural layers.

850
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,747
Even though Maki intentionally left out

851
00:41:48,781 --> 00:41:51,250
some final data in
his original hypothesis,

852
00:41:51,284 --> 00:41:54,353
we now have the complete
version we can study.

853
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:57,323
We'd like to analyze
that info. Can we do that?

854
00:41:57,356 --> 00:41:58,757
Sure.

855
00:42:02,595 --> 00:42:04,463
I'm bad at Japanese honorifics,

856
00:42:04,497 --> 00:42:07,833
so can we be informal?

857
00:42:07,866 --> 00:42:10,336
In that case,

858
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:11,670
can you tell me what it is

859
00:42:11,704 --> 00:42:14,773
that the US wants with
Gojira? Capture or kill?

860
00:42:14,807 --> 00:42:19,445
That's for the president to decide.

861
00:42:19,478 --> 00:42:22,415
Who is it that decides in your country?

862
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:28,421
So, the cabinet finally made a decision

863
00:42:28,454 --> 00:42:30,022
on the relief and recovery bill?

864
00:42:30,055 --> 00:42:31,956
If you thought that was
an interagency nightmare,

865
00:42:31,957 --> 00:42:33,459
wait until the Gojira bill.

866
00:42:33,492 --> 00:42:34,459
- Yeah.
- I guarantee a lack of

867
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,629
precedent's going to
cloud orders, and I bet

868
00:42:36,662 --> 00:42:39,398
you can expect a lot of passing
the buck to happen, too.

869
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,699
I can't believe it.

870
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:42,368
The security bill passed so easily.

871
00:42:42,401 --> 00:42:44,970
Foreign Ministry muscle,
and US pressure, of course.

872
00:42:45,003 --> 00:42:46,805
From what I've
been told about that deal,

873
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:49,842
the US wants to use its Gojira
info as a diplomatic card.

874
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:51,477
Well, if that's the case

875
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,946
let's pray that Aide Akasaka
can handle the White House.

876
00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:55,614
Based on all the analysis we've done,

877
00:42:55,648 --> 00:42:57,383
I can positively say
that these gamma rays

878
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:59,885
match no known elements whatsoever.

879
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:02,855
It's unprecedented.
Gojira is it?

880
00:43:02,888 --> 00:43:04,457
Its body is harboring new elements

881
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:07,460
that are unknown to science.

882
00:43:07,493 --> 00:43:08,861
Well, this certainly explains why

883
00:43:08,894 --> 00:43:12,731
the US Department of Energy
moved so quickly.

884
00:43:12,765 --> 00:43:15,334
Take this data with us.
Call the PM.

885
00:43:15,368 --> 00:43:16,402
Right.

886
00:43:16,435 --> 00:43:21,006
Understood. This is going
to complicate things.

887
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:25,043
So... how much do we say?

888
00:43:25,077 --> 00:43:27,112
Having fully analyzed
substances recovered

889
00:43:27,145 --> 00:43:30,082
from its path, we can
confirm the following...

890
00:43:30,115 --> 00:43:32,518
In the stricken area,
radiation has risen

891
00:43:32,551 --> 00:43:34,820
to point-five sieverts but is not...

892
00:43:34,853 --> 00:43:36,021
Thanks for the food.

893
00:43:36,054 --> 00:43:37,956
Yes, thank you.

894
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,359
Even with this new
information the US agreed

895
00:43:40,393 --> 00:43:43,496
to share with us, I still think
we can expect some gridlock.

896
00:43:43,529 --> 00:43:45,030
Yeah, Riken's report had impact,

897
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:47,533
but in addition to that,
Gojira has eight times

898
00:43:47,566 --> 00:43:49,602
the amount of genetic info of humans.

899
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:51,435
It's literally gonna
take us years to sequence

900
00:43:51,437 --> 00:43:52,871
all of that genetic material.

901
00:43:52,905 --> 00:43:54,607
I think we can agree Gojira is the most

902
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,909
evolved creature
this planet has ever seen.

903
00:43:56,942 --> 00:43:58,911
Capable of self-mutation

904
00:43:58,944 --> 00:44:01,647
to best fit the
environment that it's in.

905
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,582
That trumps human intelligence.

906
00:44:03,616 --> 00:44:07,085
It's still mortal, though.
So it can be killed.

907
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,286
I sure hope so.

908
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,458
That's exactly what we're
all here to find out, Professor.

909
00:44:12,491 --> 00:44:14,893
Well, does anyone have
any clues into its behavior?

910
00:44:14,927 --> 00:44:16,495
All it does is walk.

911
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,030
One thing I don't understand.

912
00:44:18,063 --> 00:44:20,599
Why did it return to Tokyo Bay?

913
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:25,538
That's it.

914
00:44:25,571 --> 00:44:27,906
For cooling.

915
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,409
Gojira has something
akin to a nuclear reactor

916
00:44:30,443 --> 00:44:33,178
in its body, and its fins
must serve as heat vents.

917
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:35,047
And if that is indeed
the case, then its blood

918
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,683
more than likely serves as
the body's cooling system!

919
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,453
I get it. You're saying that
it temporarily retrogressed

920
00:44:40,486 --> 00:44:42,688
to sea creature so it could
adjust its body temperature

921
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,022
after mutating, eh?

922
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,757
Maybe our only hope
is to try and find a way

923
00:44:45,758 --> 00:44:47,125
to shut it down.

924
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:48,994
Its internal cooling system, that is.

925
00:44:49,027 --> 00:44:51,063
Then not only would we
need to force Gojira

926
00:44:51,096 --> 00:44:53,566
to shut off its internal
reactor to stay alive,

927
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,634
but also find a way
to cool its blood down,

928
00:44:55,668 --> 00:44:58,136
and so much so that we can
immobilize the creature.

929
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,473
Just as a suggestion,
what about administering

930
00:45:00,506 --> 00:45:01,974
a blood-coagulating drug?

931
00:45:02,007 --> 00:45:04,477
Wait, is that even possible
with Gojira upright?

932
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:06,645
We'll investigate
a few practical methods.

933
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:09,615
Perhaps a compression
pump system like this.

934
00:45:09,648 --> 00:45:12,184
We, the Health Ministry
and METI, will gather all of

935
00:45:12,217 --> 00:45:13,952
the necessary coagulant and equipment

936
00:45:13,986 --> 00:45:15,588
that will be required for this op.

937
00:45:15,621 --> 00:45:18,524
We're submitting this to the Prime Minister
as "The Yaguchi Plan."

938
00:45:18,557 --> 00:45:21,494
Understood.

939
00:45:21,527 --> 00:45:23,729
Name aside.
Let's get to it.

940
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,197
Sir.

941
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,932
Gojira's God, save Gojira!

942
00:45:26,965 --> 00:45:31,203
Gojira's God, save Gojira!
Gojira's God, save Gojira!

943
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,133
Care for some tea, sir?

944
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:03,769
Yes. Thanks so much.

945
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,804
Thank you, ma'am.

946
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,842
Hey. We need a break.

947
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:11,043
- Okay.
- All right.

948
00:46:11,076 --> 00:46:13,245
Got it.

949
00:46:19,585 --> 00:46:22,888
I see everyone voluntarily
doing whatever they can.

950
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:24,321
They haven't gone home
to rest even though

951
00:46:24,322 --> 00:46:26,692
they've all been urged to.

952
00:46:26,725 --> 00:46:29,027
There are some staff members
who've actually brought in

953
00:46:29,061 --> 00:46:32,898
hot meals for everybody that's here.

954
00:46:32,931 --> 00:46:34,667
It's very inspiring.

955
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,569
No jurisdictional infighting.

956
00:46:36,602 --> 00:46:38,571
No arguments between ministries.

957
00:46:38,604 --> 00:46:41,540
Just people working together
for the common good.

958
00:46:41,574 --> 00:46:43,241
And not just staff, either.

959
00:46:43,275 --> 00:46:44,609
There're a lot of outsiders who've

960
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:46,945
volunteered their time, too.

961
00:46:46,979 --> 00:46:49,882
Yeah, you're right.

962
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:52,317
There's hope for this country.

963
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,919
That there is.

964
00:46:53,952 --> 00:46:56,254
Just one question, though.

965
00:46:56,288 --> 00:46:58,891
When was the last time
you changed that shirt?

966
00:46:58,924 --> 00:47:00,092
Mm?

967
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:03,028
To be honest, your shirt
smells pretty rank.

968
00:47:05,163 --> 00:47:06,832
Really?

969
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:10,202
A shower and a change
of clothes wouldn't hurt.

970
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,644
Yaguchi! Gojira's
resurfaced in Sagami Bay!

971
00:47:18,677 --> 00:47:19,978
And it's coming ashore!

972
00:47:36,795 --> 00:47:37,830
J-Alert!

973
00:47:37,863 --> 00:47:40,833
The lifeform designated
"Gojira" has come ashore!

974
00:47:40,866 --> 00:47:44,670
Primary evacuation order over
Em-net has been transmitted!

975
00:47:45,938 --> 00:47:49,942
This is an emergency evacuation order.

976
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:52,611
This is not a drill.

977
00:47:53,812 --> 00:47:56,214
A colossal-sized, unidentified creature

978
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,150
has come ashore.

979
00:47:58,183 --> 00:48:00,919
For public safety, citizens are urged

980
00:48:00,953 --> 00:48:03,188
to evacuate the city immediately.

981
00:48:05,357 --> 00:48:08,326
Repeat, evacuate immediately.

982
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,097
Please follow the instructions
of police and fire personnel.

983
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,899
The Prime Minster.

984
00:48:47,733 --> 00:48:48,867
On its current route,

985
00:48:48,901 --> 00:48:51,136
Gojira's moving towards Kamariya.

986
00:48:51,169 --> 00:48:54,272
Wait. Am I crazy
or has it gotten bigger?

987
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,842
Yes, and beyond expectation.

988
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:58,777
Both its face and body look different!

989
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:02,380
Yes. Its size has nearly doubled.

990
00:49:02,414 --> 00:49:05,617
Gojira's evolved
and into its fourth form.

991
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:12,324
Oh no, this is going to be disastrous.

992
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:23,736
Attention! Citizens are to take refuge

993
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:25,704
indoors immediately!

994
00:49:25,738 --> 00:49:27,840
This area is now under official curfew

995
00:49:27,873 --> 00:49:29,775
and the streets must be cleared!

996
00:49:29,808 --> 00:49:31,343
Attention!
You are in a designated

997
00:49:31,376 --> 00:49:33,912
evacuation zone and
must leave the area now!

998
00:49:33,946 --> 00:49:35,748
Please proceed and follow the directions

999
00:49:35,781 --> 00:49:38,083
of police and safety personnel!

1000
00:49:53,832 --> 00:49:55,300
Gojira is currently projected

1001
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:57,770
to reach Tokyo in three hours.

1002
00:49:57,803 --> 00:50:00,138
But why the hell is it coming here?

1003
00:50:22,294 --> 00:50:25,297
An armed assault on
its body has potential risks.

1004
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,399
Namely the release
of radioactive materials

1005
00:50:27,432 --> 00:50:28,934
into the surrounding region.

1006
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:31,136
So, preventing it from
reaching the metro area,

1007
00:50:31,169 --> 00:50:33,906
that must be our top
priority, in my opinion.

1008
00:50:33,939 --> 00:50:36,842
I hear this thing lives
on radioactive material.

1009
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:39,978
If this Gojira were to
attack a nuclear facility,

1010
00:50:40,012 --> 00:50:42,114
this disaster would be far worse.

1011
00:50:42,147 --> 00:50:47,219
Sir. We must stop it, and stop it now.

1012
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,387
That's right. And also
because if we don't,

1013
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,790
we'll be viewed overseas as timid.

1014
00:50:51,824 --> 00:50:53,992
How is your Yaguchi Plan coming along?

1015
00:50:54,026 --> 00:50:56,394
Regrettably, it's not ready yet.

1016
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,230
All you have to do is give the order

1017
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,232
and the SDF will do its job.

1018
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,868
The state of emergency
is still in effect,

1019
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:06,805
so the only one
who can order an attack...

1020
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:10,943
is you, and you alone.

1021
00:51:10,976 --> 00:51:12,244
Well, sir?

1022
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,847
I know.

1023
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,815
Commence attack.

1024
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:19,584
Right away, sir.
Contact command.

1025
00:51:19,617 --> 00:51:20,618
Right.

1026
00:51:20,652 --> 00:51:23,221
The Prime Minister
has just ordered an attack.

1027
00:51:23,255 --> 00:51:25,457
We've been given
unrestricted weapon use.

1028
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,560
With this directive, we must
do whatever it takes

1029
00:51:28,593 --> 00:51:31,163
to prevent Gojira from reaching Tokyo.

1030
00:51:31,196 --> 00:51:33,231
So Plan B if it goes to Kanagawa?

1031
00:51:33,265 --> 00:51:36,869
Yes. We'll make Kawasaki
the primary battleground.

1032
00:51:36,902 --> 00:51:38,103
Are we clear on that?

1033
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,172
Yes, sir. And the Tama River will be our

1034
00:51:40,205 --> 00:51:43,942
absolute defense line.
Let's go kill that thing.

1035
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:46,211
Taxi to holding point B1.

1036
00:51:46,244 --> 00:51:47,880
Runway one-zero.

1037
00:51:47,913 --> 00:51:48,981
Runway one-zero

1038
00:51:49,014 --> 00:51:50,849
cleared for takeoff.

1039
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,121
Attack formation report

1040
00:51:56,154 --> 00:52:00,993
five miles west. P0304 now
embarking from Tachikawa.

1041
00:52:01,026 --> 00:52:02,493
Tanks and artillery have been deployed

1042
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,329
to Maruko Bridge.

1043
00:52:04,362 --> 00:52:06,865
Roger. Ready attack positions.

1044
00:52:06,899 --> 00:52:08,566
Please let this work.

1045
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,169
Eight minutes to contact with target!

1046
00:52:11,203 --> 00:52:13,138
We're really engaging in live fire?

1047
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:15,173
Just relax.
It's like our drills.

1048
00:52:15,207 --> 00:52:18,176
The target's body contains
radioactive material.

1049
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:21,880
So pinpoint your attacks solely
on the thing's head and legs.

1050
00:52:21,914 --> 00:52:24,149
All battalions ready to fire.

1051
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,383
Target approaching!

1052
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:27,419
ETA is three minutes and counting!

1053
00:52:27,452 --> 00:52:29,054
First to fourth chopper squadrons

1054
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:30,855
are arriving now!

1055
00:52:33,926 --> 00:52:36,394
CO1, this is CP, over.

1056
00:52:36,428 --> 00:52:38,596
Copy CP. CO1, over.

1057
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,332
CO1 to PP1.

1058
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:44,136
PO1 in flight over
Musahi-Kosugi, holding at BP1.

1059
00:52:44,169 --> 00:52:46,171
PO2 to PO4 behind towers.

1060
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:49,041
Standby at Holding Area 2, over.

1061
00:52:49,074 --> 00:52:51,243
CO1 ready to engage at PP1.

1062
00:52:51,276 --> 00:52:53,478
Target distance at 1,200 meters.

1063
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:56,381
Roger. Maintain positions, over.

1064
00:52:56,414 --> 00:52:57,649
All helicopter reconnaissance

1065
00:52:57,682 --> 00:52:59,284
has now been completed.

1066
00:52:59,317 --> 00:53:01,619
Total area evacuation
has been confirmed.

1067
00:53:01,653 --> 00:53:04,556
Koriyama.
Are you sure this time?

1068
00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:06,091
No stragglers?

1069
00:53:06,124 --> 00:53:08,626
I trust the report that
we received from the field.

1070
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,929
Madame. The target is advancing.

1071
00:53:10,963 --> 00:53:13,665
Sir, please authorize the use of force.

1072
00:53:13,698 --> 00:53:16,268
I authorize its use.

1073
00:53:16,301 --> 00:53:17,235
Commence.

1074
00:53:17,269 --> 00:53:19,671
The PM just confirmed the order.

1075
00:53:19,704 --> 00:53:22,074
Commence fire.
Light that thing up.

1076
00:53:22,107 --> 00:53:24,109
Phase 1 is now a go, Commander.

1077
00:53:24,142 --> 00:53:27,545
Commence fire.
Repeat, commence fire. Over.

1078
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:30,148
CO1 copy. Commencing fire.

1079
00:53:30,182 --> 00:53:32,450
Ready. Fire!

1080
00:53:40,058 --> 00:53:44,462
Autocannon direct hits
are thus far ineffective!

1081
00:53:44,496 --> 00:53:46,464
Try the Apache's 30 millimeter.

1082
00:53:46,498 --> 00:53:48,466
Let's give it a shot.

1083
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:57,575
Third squadron in reconnaissance.

1084
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,677
Report on effectiveness, over.

1085
00:53:59,711 --> 00:54:02,547
Third squadron on site. Target is fine.

1086
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,216
No effect.

1087
00:54:04,249 --> 00:54:07,552
So 16,000 rounds of machine gun fire

1088
00:54:07,585 --> 00:54:09,387
and it didn't leave a scratch.

1089
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:11,256
Get HQ and the PM.

1090
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:16,394
It's the Commander.
He's requesting to use missiles.

1091
00:54:16,428 --> 00:54:19,031
It's a dense area,
but we have no other choice.

1092
00:54:19,064 --> 00:54:21,233
Permission to use missiles, sir?

1093
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:26,204
I authorize... the use of all weapons.

1094
00:54:26,238 --> 00:54:27,705
Give the word!

1095
00:54:27,739 --> 00:54:30,208
CO1, switch weapons systems to missiles.

1096
00:54:30,242 --> 00:54:33,511
When you've got a lock on the
target, fire them all, over!

1097
00:54:33,545 --> 00:54:36,481
Roger! PO1 to PO4, switch to missiles.

1098
00:54:36,514 --> 00:54:38,650
Target straight ahead 700 meters!

1099
00:54:38,683 --> 00:54:40,318
Locked on!

1100
00:54:40,352 --> 00:54:42,420
Ready. Fire!

1101
00:54:48,826 --> 00:54:51,429
Keep giving that thing hell, boys!

1102
00:55:03,408 --> 00:55:05,643
All direct hits, but no
visible damage sustained,

1103
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,345
and it's still alive.

1104
00:55:07,379 --> 00:55:09,047
Even missiles don't work?

1105
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:10,548
What is this thing?

1106
00:55:10,582 --> 00:55:13,285
Nothing's piercing
the skin of that monster!

1107
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:15,320
Time to shift to Phase ♪2.

1108
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,254
Copy that, Commander.

1109
00:55:16,288 --> 00:55:18,190
Commencing to Phase 2 of the operation.

1110
00:55:18,223 --> 00:55:20,058
Commence fire.

1111
00:55:20,092 --> 00:55:22,260
Repeat, commence fire.

1112
00:55:22,294 --> 00:55:25,397
Roger that. This is Tiger 1.
Commencing fire.

1113
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:27,799
Type 10 tanks, aim for the target's legs

1114
00:55:27,832 --> 00:55:29,401
and unleash a concentrated barrage

1115
00:55:29,434 --> 00:55:30,735
on the commander's order!

1116
00:55:30,768 --> 00:55:34,539
Ready. Lock on.
There it is!

1117
00:55:34,572 --> 00:55:35,840
Distance good!

1118
00:55:35,873 --> 00:55:37,475
Fire!

1119
00:55:40,512 --> 00:55:42,747
Direct hit! Keep firing!

1120
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,588
The target, it's decreased speed!

1121
00:55:50,622 --> 00:55:52,290
Good! It's working!

1122
00:55:52,324 --> 00:55:54,359
Now commence artillery fire!

1123
00:55:56,494 --> 00:55:57,595
Time to target.

1124
00:55:57,629 --> 00:56:05,437
Seven... six... five... four...
three... two... one...

1125
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:07,839
Impact!

1126
00:56:07,872 --> 00:56:11,443
All hit target! Fusillade. Fire!

1127
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,768
Sir, the target has just been sighted

1128
00:56:36,801 --> 00:56:38,370
entering the Tama River!

1129
00:56:38,403 --> 00:56:41,273
Tell Gotemba to attack.
Launch all rockets!

1130
00:56:51,549 --> 00:56:53,451
The target! It's halted!

1131
00:56:53,485 --> 00:56:55,253
Time to move to Phase 3.

1132
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,522
Launch the aerial assault on Gojira.

1133
00:56:57,555 --> 00:56:59,524
Type 10 tanks, shift to Phase 3!

1134
00:56:59,557 --> 00:57:03,828
I repeat, all tanks shift to
Phase 3 positions immediately!

1135
00:57:03,861 --> 00:57:06,431
Roger. Cleared for attack.

1136
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:09,367
Ready. Aim. Now!

1137
00:57:10,602 --> 00:57:12,637
Bombs away!

1138
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,906
Laser on. Tracking.

1139
00:57:26,884 --> 00:57:29,587
Bullseye!
The target is turning northwest!

1140
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:31,823
Repeat, it's heading northwest!

1141
00:57:31,856 --> 00:57:33,225
It's turning away?

1142
00:57:33,258 --> 00:57:35,293
You mean this plan is working?

1143
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:36,928
JDAM second wave's next.

1144
00:57:36,961 --> 00:57:39,564
Yes, that'll finish it off.

1145
00:57:49,474 --> 00:57:51,276
Way to go!

1146
00:57:53,611 --> 00:57:55,647
All tanks retreat now!

1147
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,648
Evacuate! Get the hell out of here now!

1148
00:58:30,682 --> 00:58:32,450
- Mayday!
- Come on. Come on.

1149
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,256
Attention, target
has crossed into Tokyo!

1150
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:41,659
ACP, CO1. Choppers are out of munitions!

1151
00:58:41,693 --> 00:58:43,595
Repeat, munitions exhausted!

1152
00:58:43,628 --> 00:58:47,399
Tiger 1, this is 40.
Give us a status report over.

1153
00:58:47,432 --> 00:58:49,967
This is Tiger 1.
Eight squads are out of ammo.

1154
00:58:50,001 --> 00:58:51,803
Three tanks are severely damaged,

1155
00:58:51,836 --> 00:58:54,306
and two others are crippled, over.

1156
00:58:59,877 --> 00:59:01,446
It's confirmed, sirs.

1157
00:59:01,479 --> 00:59:03,615
The forward command post
has been destroyed!

1158
00:59:03,648 --> 00:59:05,517
The target's breached the defense line!

1159
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:08,353
Our defensive position
has collapsed entirely!

1160
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:13,458
Sir, that creature.

1161
00:59:13,491 --> 00:59:15,693
It's still within artillery range.

1162
00:59:15,727 --> 00:59:17,529
Let's continue the assault.

1163
00:59:17,562 --> 00:59:21,366
We can't. Those wards still
aren't fully evacuated yet.

1164
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,602
Sorry, but I'm afraid
that's all we can do.

1165
00:59:24,636 --> 00:59:27,605
Understood.

1166
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:29,707
We'll suspend the operation.

1167
00:59:29,741 --> 00:59:32,444
We couldn't stop it.
Sorry, sir.

1168
00:59:32,477 --> 00:59:34,045
Don't lose hope.

1169
00:59:34,078 --> 00:59:36,047
It's our job to protect the people here.

1170
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,450
An offensive isn't the only way.

1171
00:59:38,483 --> 00:59:40,552
Speed up the evacuation.

1172
00:59:40,585 --> 00:59:42,320
The operation failed, and Gojira

1173
00:59:42,354 --> 00:59:43,788
is once again on the move.

1174
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:46,524
The SDF's full power
was futile against it.

1175
00:59:46,558 --> 00:59:49,327
That thing's self-preservation
ability is amazing.

1176
00:59:49,361 --> 00:59:50,928
Standard weapons won't take it down,

1177
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,830
that's why we're here, remember?

1178
00:59:52,864 --> 00:59:56,300
An organism that surpasses
man in every way.

1179
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,409
The target's been sighted

1180
01:00:04,442 --> 01:00:05,810
entering Meguro Ward!

1181
01:00:05,843 --> 01:00:08,546
Sir! Let's petition
the US for military aid

1182
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,648
in taking it down.
It's our only choice!

1183
01:00:10,682 --> 01:00:12,750
Sir. I just heard from the USAF.

1184
01:00:12,784 --> 01:00:14,352
They've confirmed that a squadron

1185
01:00:14,386 --> 01:00:16,488
of stealth bombers is already en route.

1186
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:21,693
Submit a formal cooperation request

1187
01:00:21,726 --> 01:00:24,529
to the US. I'm on my way
to meet with the ambassador.

1188
01:00:24,562 --> 01:00:25,830
With your authorization,

1189
01:00:25,863 --> 01:00:28,032
I'll hold a press
conference on the subject.

1190
01:00:28,065 --> 01:00:35,106
And so, we've requested aid by US forces in fighting
Gojira based on the Japan-US Security which...

1191
01:00:51,556 --> 01:00:54,058
The proposed US bombing zone.

1192
01:00:54,091 --> 01:00:55,827
It's this large?

1193
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,162
The damage will be worse than Gojira!

1194
01:00:58,195 --> 01:01:00,064
The bombing zone's so vast.

1195
01:01:00,097 --> 01:01:02,400
We'll have to evacuate
everyone underground!

1196
01:01:02,434 --> 01:01:03,868
The US will soon launch an attack

1197
01:01:03,901 --> 01:01:06,838
on Gojira! Please evacuate
to the nearest subway

1198
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,607
or underground shelter at this time!

1199
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:21,018
Stop pushing!

1200
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:49,814
This residence is directly
in Gojira's path, sir.

1201
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:52,484
And since the SDF failed
to stop this thing,

1202
01:01:52,517 --> 01:01:54,986
the US military might fail, too.

1203
01:01:55,019 --> 01:01:58,022
You're saying...
that we should evacuate?

1204
01:01:58,055 --> 01:02:01,726
Yes! Both you and the entire cabinet!

1205
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,761
For the nation to function,
you need to leave

1206
01:02:03,795 --> 01:02:06,698
for the secondary facility
in Tachikawa quickly!

1207
01:02:06,731 --> 01:02:09,567
Just as the US strike is about to begin?

1208
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:13,938
No, I have a duty to stay
and monitor its execution!

1209
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:17,775
And besides that, I can't
abandon the citizens here!

1210
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:19,243
You must leave.

1211
01:02:19,276 --> 01:02:21,546
Remember, you have an
entire nation to protect

1212
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:23,781
but you can't do that
if you're dead, sir.

1213
01:02:23,815 --> 01:02:25,249
So please evacuate.

1214
01:02:25,282 --> 01:02:28,085
Tokyo City Hall is still functioning.

1215
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:33,791
So for right now, please,
let the governor take charge.

1216
01:02:33,825 --> 01:02:35,126
Very well.

1217
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:37,228
Sir, two choppers'll be on the roof.

1218
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:39,831
My group will travel there by car.

1219
01:02:39,864 --> 01:02:45,269
Okay. Get going.
I'm sure it'll take some time.

1220
01:02:45,302 --> 01:02:49,140
Traffic is going to be murder.

1221
01:02:49,173 --> 01:02:50,842
We'll see you there.

1222
01:02:50,875 --> 01:02:53,177
Right. We'll get moving.

1223
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,178
Attention!

1224
01:02:54,211 --> 01:02:56,280
A mandatory evacuation
order has been issued!

1225
01:02:56,313 --> 01:02:57,515
Hurry everyone!

1226
01:02:57,549 --> 01:02:59,584
Please vacate the premises at once!

1227
01:02:59,617 --> 01:03:02,153
Repeat, a mandatory evacuation
order has been issued!

1228
01:03:02,186 --> 01:03:05,122
Please vacate the premises at once!

1229
01:03:17,201 --> 01:03:20,872
It's gridlock all over
the city. Traffic isn't moving.

1230
01:03:20,905 --> 01:03:23,575
Even so, the strike's still coming.

1231
01:03:23,608 --> 01:03:25,543
We need to get everyone out.

1232
01:03:35,753 --> 01:03:37,689
So that's Gojira.

1233
01:03:37,722 --> 01:03:39,924
Just got word.
The strike's going to occur

1234
01:03:39,957 --> 01:03:41,793
ahead of schedule!

1235
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,333
MOP II bombs have struck the target.

1236
01:03:49,366 --> 01:03:52,236
Direct hit!
It's confirmed bleeding!

1237
01:03:54,371 --> 01:03:56,040
This may work!

1238
01:03:56,073 --> 01:03:58,542
Nice job USA.

1239
01:04:06,117 --> 01:04:09,587
Sir. The helicopters are arriving.

1240
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,102
Quickly everyone! Down this way!

1241
01:04:26,403 --> 01:04:28,572
What's that glow?

1242
01:04:39,784 --> 01:04:42,687
Gojira's back has begun
to glow all of a sudden, sir!

1243
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,622
No more details than that!

1244
01:04:44,656 --> 01:04:47,158
What can it be glowing for?

1245
01:05:14,185 --> 01:05:17,922
That's everyone!
Come on, Yaguchi!

1246
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:19,056
There's an emergency call

1247
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:20,391
from Yokota Air Base.

1248
01:05:20,424 --> 01:05:22,393
B-2, Number 1 seems to have been downed!

1249
01:05:22,426 --> 01:05:26,197
But there's no way.
That's impossible!

1250
01:05:28,399 --> 01:05:32,904
Godzilla.
Truly a god incarnate.

1251
01:05:32,937 --> 01:05:34,105
The target is shooting some

1252
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:35,907
unidentified weapon from the front.

1253
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:38,275
Bomber 2 and Bomber 3
will circle in from behind.

1254
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,711
Payback time.

1255
01:05:39,744 --> 01:05:42,146
Roger. Payback.

1256
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,746
The Prime Minister and his cabinet

1257
01:06:14,779 --> 01:06:16,914
are on board and
en route to Tachikawa...

1258
01:07:21,178 --> 01:07:22,513
High levels of radiation

1259
01:07:22,546 --> 01:07:24,816
have been projected.
For their safety,

1260
01:07:24,849 --> 01:07:27,218
people are urged to
remain indoors for at least

1261
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:28,820
another 49 hours.

1262
01:07:28,853 --> 01:07:30,053
How much radiation the creature

1263
01:07:30,054 --> 01:07:32,423
has released on Tokyo is still unknown.

1264
01:07:32,456 --> 01:07:34,191
Due to the attack, expect emergency

1265
01:07:34,225 --> 01:07:36,060
services to be severely delayed.

1266
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:37,394
I hear radioactivity is high.

1267
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,396
Will the government
distribute iodine tablets?

1268
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,032
Authorities are urging residents...

1269
01:07:41,065 --> 01:07:43,334
Nuclear, biological, and chemical

1270
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:45,035
response teams are being
deployed throughout the city

1271
01:07:45,036 --> 01:07:46,537
for decontamination and rescue.

1272
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:48,940
A government spokesperson
stated that these teams

1273
01:07:48,973 --> 01:07:50,206
will arrive in all affected areas...

1274
01:07:50,207 --> 01:07:52,243
The Prime Minister, Cabinet Secretary,

1275
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:54,378
and five ministers are still
missing at this hour,

1276
01:07:54,411 --> 01:07:56,380
and presumed dead after their helicopter

1277
01:07:56,413 --> 01:07:58,082
was blown from the sky.

1278
01:07:58,115 --> 01:07:59,817
Police headquarters and two ministries

1279
01:07:59,851 --> 01:08:01,118
still remain intact.

1280
01:08:01,152 --> 01:08:03,053
Other government buildings
didn't fare as well...

1281
01:08:03,054 --> 01:08:04,521
to describe what I'm

1282
01:08:04,555 --> 01:08:06,223
looking at right now is "apocalyptic."

1283
01:08:06,257 --> 01:08:08,125
It's almost like looking
at the historic photos

1284
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:10,427
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
after the bombs were dropped,

1285
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:12,163
but then you realize
what you're staring at

1286
01:08:12,196 --> 01:08:14,031
is actually right in front of you.

1287
01:08:14,065 --> 01:08:15,933
refugees left homeless

1288
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,935
in the city are estimated
to be in the millions,

1289
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:19,449
and that number is rising every hour.

1290
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,238
With the Prime Minister presumed dead,

1291
01:08:21,272 --> 01:08:23,407
government officials are racing
to select an acting PM

1292
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,442
to fill the political vacuum created by

1293
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:27,178
the tragic events of last night.

1294
01:08:27,211 --> 01:08:28,880
With the PM residence still

1295
01:08:28,913 --> 01:08:30,646
in the path of danger,
government headquarters

1296
01:08:30,647 --> 01:08:32,483
are being moved to Tachikawa City.

1297
01:08:32,516 --> 01:08:34,650
Several miles from the city
center, it's hoped it will be

1298
01:08:34,651 --> 01:08:37,588
a safer location for the
government's base of operations.

1299
01:08:39,623 --> 01:08:41,525
Attention, all staff.

1300
01:08:41,558 --> 01:08:44,395
Decontamination protocols
have been enacted.

1301
01:08:44,428 --> 01:08:46,063
Interior access...

1302
01:08:46,097 --> 01:08:47,331
Chief Yaguchi!

1303
01:08:47,364 --> 01:08:49,233
- I'll call you back.
- Izumi, you're safe.

1304
01:08:49,266 --> 01:08:51,035
Yeah, only for one reason.

1305
01:08:51,068 --> 01:08:52,635
It's because I went home
on Friday night.

1306
01:08:52,636 --> 01:08:54,939
That's the sole thing that saved me.

1307
01:08:54,972 --> 01:08:56,908
Hey. Do you know that you're bleeding?

1308
01:08:56,941 --> 01:08:58,442
- You okay?
- Yeah, sorry.

1309
01:08:58,475 --> 01:09:00,377
They said bandages were in short supply.

1310
01:09:00,411 --> 01:09:02,947
I know, everything is.

1311
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:05,082
Tokyo is directing fire and rescue.

1312
01:09:05,116 --> 01:09:06,617
We have no Internal Ministry yet.

1313
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:08,119
Let the police handle refugees.

1314
01:09:08,152 --> 01:09:09,152
We're working on it, okay?

1315
01:09:09,153 --> 01:09:10,487
They'll have to hold out

1316
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:11,923
for one more night.

1317
01:09:11,956 --> 01:09:13,224
Rumors will fly,

1318
01:09:13,257 --> 01:09:14,959
so get on the press now.

1319
01:09:14,992 --> 01:09:17,494
I need information now.
Where's Gojira?

1320
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,463
It's inactive near Tokyo Station.

1321
01:09:19,496 --> 01:09:21,665
And the reason for that?
Who knows why?

1322
01:09:21,698 --> 01:09:23,167
And radiation levels?

1323
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,136
The Nuclear Regulation Authority.

1324
01:09:25,169 --> 01:09:27,438
They're out getting readings right now.

1325
01:09:27,471 --> 01:09:29,974
They did inform me earlier
that radiation is dripping

1326
01:09:30,007 --> 01:09:32,676
from Gojira's mouth,
but it's only trace amounts.

1327
01:09:32,709 --> 01:09:35,312
Gojira's radioactive plume
blew out to sea,

1328
01:09:35,346 --> 01:09:37,581
but contamination is still widespread.

1329
01:09:37,614 --> 01:09:40,517
So then the hardest-hit areas
aren't just uninhabitable now.

1330
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,186
They're contaminated as well.

1331
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:45,189
Yeah, conditions are
about as dire as they can get.

1332
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:47,224
We're lacking in manpower, materials,

1333
01:09:47,258 --> 01:09:48,926
and even political infrastructure.

1334
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,261
They're all dead.

1335
01:09:50,294 --> 01:09:53,030
The Prime Minister and
the Chief Cabinet Secretary.

1336
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,598
Everyone who was on the evac chopper.

1337
01:09:54,631 --> 01:09:56,567
Don't go to pieces!

1338
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,203
We'll just make do with
the few staff that's left!

1339
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:01,538
Yaguchi.

1340
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,208
Calm down first, okay?

1341
01:10:21,725 --> 01:10:26,063
I'm sorry.

1342
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:27,965
Who's been made the acting PM?

1343
01:10:27,999 --> 01:10:31,668
The ruling party has just announced that
Minister of Agriculture Yusuke Satomi

1344
01:10:31,702 --> 01:10:34,171
has been named as Acting Prime Minister.

1345
01:10:34,205 --> 01:10:36,207
He will head the provisional
emergency government

1346
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,575
that has been quickly set up
and has stated that

1347
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,289
his first order of
business will be to name

1348
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:43,347
a new cabinet to fill
the political void.

1349
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:46,283
So then, the Agriculture Minister

1350
01:10:46,317 --> 01:10:49,520
is now the Prime Minister
because of his seniority?

1351
01:10:49,553 --> 01:10:52,623
That's who they chose?
But why him?

1352
01:10:52,656 --> 01:10:54,491
Well, I heard the job was foisted on him

1353
01:10:54,525 --> 01:10:57,995
by the party secretary.
Can you blame them?

1354
01:10:58,029 --> 01:11:00,264
Who wants responsibility
at a time like this?

1355
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:01,797
What should we do about
the disturbing movement

1356
01:11:01,798 --> 01:11:03,767
near Tsushima Island?

1357
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:08,139
Well, I suppose we'll just
have to wait and see.

1358
01:11:08,172 --> 01:11:10,307
Can the Foreign Ministry act?

1359
01:11:10,341 --> 01:11:12,301
We're still getting up and
running right now, sir,

1360
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:13,510
but soon.

1361
01:11:13,544 --> 01:11:15,746
Well, at any rate, try to avoid

1362
01:11:15,779 --> 01:11:17,681
any unforeseen surprises.

1363
01:11:17,714 --> 01:11:21,318
Right. I'll let the ambassador know.

1364
01:11:28,559 --> 01:11:34,065
Noodles got soggy.

1365
01:11:34,098 --> 01:11:38,335
I knew this job wasn't going
to be easy, but come on.

1366
01:11:38,369 --> 01:11:41,472
Yeah, that guy.
He's a hard man to read.

1367
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:43,140
Whoever the PM is,

1368
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:45,342
it's our job to keep
the government afloat.

1369
01:11:45,376 --> 01:11:47,611
We need emergency powers.

1370
01:11:47,644 --> 01:11:49,746
I know.
We're 30 kilometers from

1371
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:52,216
where Gojira's sleeping.
Scary, huh?

1372
01:11:52,249 --> 01:11:53,809
I'm more concerned about something else

1373
01:11:53,817 --> 01:11:56,720
right at the moment.
The decisions that will

1374
01:11:56,753 --> 01:11:59,490
be made to stop Gojira by the acting PM.

1375
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:01,325
You want his job?

1376
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:03,127
Not right now.

1377
01:12:05,429 --> 01:12:07,064
But maybe in ten years.

1378
01:12:07,098 --> 01:12:08,499
Yeah, if Japan's still around then,

1379
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:10,334
you should run for office.

1380
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:14,171
I'll help you, in exchange
for a nice cabinet position.

1381
01:12:17,508 --> 01:12:21,545
Akasaka was in Yokota
last night, so he survived.

1382
01:12:21,578 --> 01:12:26,183
Every politician needs two things,
strategy and luck.

1383
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:29,820
He has both and now he's
Chief Cabinet Secretary.

1384
01:12:29,853 --> 01:12:32,723
You could be more
ambitious like him, y'know?

1385
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:37,228
The Disaster Bureau is
still a unique path for you.

1386
01:12:37,261 --> 01:12:39,430
Just think about it.

1387
01:12:39,463 --> 01:12:41,632
You're practically in charge
of this group here.

1388
01:12:41,665 --> 01:12:44,468
No, I'm not. I'm here
to take the fall if needed.

1389
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:47,871
Akasaka is a shrewd delegator.

1390
01:12:47,904 --> 01:12:50,274
If anyone gets a career boost from this,

1391
01:12:50,307 --> 01:12:52,109
that person's going to be you.

1392
01:12:52,143 --> 01:12:55,112
What exactly's wrong with that?

1393
01:12:55,146 --> 01:12:57,748
If you don't like politicians,
why'd you become one?

1394
01:12:57,781 --> 01:12:59,550
Because it's just friend or foe.

1395
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,685
It's simple. I like that.

1396
01:13:01,718 --> 01:13:04,755
Excuse me, sir.
Bureau members have arrived.

1397
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:10,894
I'm so happy to see you all.

1398
01:13:10,927 --> 01:13:13,664
Over half of our team
has returned to duty.

1399
01:13:13,697 --> 01:13:16,333
Thank you.

1400
01:13:16,367 --> 01:13:20,437
Our hearts are broken
over all those we've lost.

1401
01:13:20,471 --> 01:13:23,474
Let's do this for them!

1402
01:13:23,507 --> 01:13:25,776
Honor their sacrifice.

1403
01:13:25,809 --> 01:13:30,681
We're all hurting.
But I assure you that together

1404
01:13:30,714 --> 01:13:34,351
we can and will prevail!

1405
01:13:34,385 --> 01:13:36,787
For our country's sake.

1406
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:39,256
I ask you, please pour
your hearts and souls

1407
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:41,792
into completing our work!

1408
01:13:41,825 --> 01:13:43,827
I beg you!

1409
01:13:50,834 --> 01:13:52,369
Well, let's get to it!

1410
01:13:52,403 --> 01:13:54,405
Yes, sir!

1411
01:14:04,515 --> 01:14:05,716
- Chief Mori.
- Yes?

1412
01:14:05,749 --> 01:14:07,451
Where are we with the freezing plan?

1413
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:09,419
At the moment, we've got
several private companies

1414
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,688
formulating 24 different
blood pro-coagulants,

1415
01:14:11,722 --> 01:14:13,524
using silica, thrombin, and other agents

1416
01:14:13,557 --> 01:14:15,792
you'll see here in these specs.

1417
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:17,694
We're hoping at least
one of them will work.

1418
01:14:17,728 --> 01:14:18,795
What about samples?

1419
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:20,897
We've asked GSDF for some living samples

1420
01:14:20,931 --> 01:14:23,500
and they're retrieving
them now as we speak.

1421
01:14:27,238 --> 01:14:28,639
Roger that.

1422
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:30,607
Samples retrieved. Orders?

1423
01:14:30,641 --> 01:14:33,744
I'm requesting that some be
sent directly to BSL4 labs.

1424
01:14:33,777 --> 01:14:36,747
Very good. Send the remainder
to any P3 level lab,

1425
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,848
and it doesn't matter if it's
a public or private one.

1426
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:39,682
But, sir, these samples are

1427
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:41,852
government-classified substances.

1428
01:14:41,885 --> 01:14:45,289
I know, but we need
diverse info on Gojira.

1429
01:14:46,257 --> 01:14:48,259
No change to radiation levels.

1430
01:14:48,292 --> 01:14:50,461
They're still reading
at Below 1 Sievert.

1431
01:14:50,494 --> 01:14:51,728
Still sleeping.

1432
01:14:51,762 --> 01:14:54,665
And apparently
storing radiation in its belly.

1433
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:58,269
Shift change. Let's go.

1434
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:01,805
Yes? Yaguchi.

1435
01:15:01,838 --> 01:15:03,707
It's me. I'm arriving in five minutes.

1436
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:06,310
Secure a meeting with
the acting Prime Minister.

1437
01:15:06,343 --> 01:15:08,579
So then, you wish
to provide us with something

1438
01:15:08,612 --> 01:15:11,415
to assist in our fight, is that correct?

1439
01:15:11,448 --> 01:15:14,251
Yes. There is a movement centered on

1440
01:15:14,285 --> 01:15:16,720
China and Russia,
to take Godzilla from under

1441
01:15:16,753 --> 01:15:18,722
the control of the Japanese government,

1442
01:15:18,755 --> 01:15:21,792
and put it under the control of
international organizations.

1443
01:15:21,825 --> 01:15:25,429
Many countries are aligned
with that opinion, too.

1444
01:15:25,462 --> 01:15:28,599
However, as for the US government,

1445
01:15:28,632 --> 01:15:30,701
we strongly hope that Japan and the US

1446
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:33,837
can perfectly control Godzilla together.

1447
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:36,640
Okay.

1448
01:15:36,673 --> 01:15:38,309
From the government's point of view,

1449
01:15:38,342 --> 01:15:40,344
it is for that reason
that we would agree

1450
01:15:40,377 --> 01:15:43,514
to a two-plus-two cooperation.

1451
01:15:43,547 --> 01:15:45,048
However...

1452
01:15:45,081 --> 01:15:47,318
As army experts will
remain as the backbone

1453
01:15:47,351 --> 01:15:49,386
of the government,
we have to respectfully

1454
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,388
decline your offer
to remain at the center

1455
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:57,628
of the decision-making.
In place of that, we will...

1456
01:15:57,661 --> 01:16:00,564
So a US-Japan Gojira research coalition?

1457
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:02,766
The way I see it,
the more knowledge, the better.

1458
01:16:02,799 --> 01:16:04,968
Now let's clear some space.

1459
01:16:05,001 --> 01:16:09,640
Nice to meet you.
I'm Rando Yaguchi.

1460
01:16:09,673 --> 01:16:11,074
This is from GSDF's latest

1461
01:16:11,107 --> 01:16:13,410
unmanned surveillance system.

1462
01:16:17,414 --> 01:16:19,816
It froze shortly after the attack.

1463
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:22,453
Same as the D2 simulation.

1464
01:16:22,486 --> 01:16:24,087
Just as I thought.

1465
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,822
It appears that Godzilla
has something like

1466
01:16:25,856 --> 01:16:28,359
a built-in phased-array radar.

1467
01:16:28,392 --> 01:16:30,594
If so, then that means
it can instinctively

1468
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:33,664
detect and intercept
any approaching objects.

1469
01:16:36,533 --> 01:16:39,770
Squad 2, this is CV1.
Five minutes from point zero.

1470
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:41,572
Ten minutes remain. Over.

1471
01:16:41,605 --> 01:16:44,307
Copy that. CV1. Over.

1472
01:16:51,782 --> 01:16:54,385
After cross-referencing
the field data with Tsukuba's,

1473
01:16:54,418 --> 01:16:56,820
I believe we've discovered how
Gojira plans to propagate,

1474
01:16:56,853 --> 01:16:59,390
I'm sure of it.

1475
01:16:59,423 --> 01:17:00,724
With abilities like these,

1476
01:17:00,757 --> 01:17:03,727
it could rapidly colonize
the entire world.

1477
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,030
Its body can evolve.
Make itself smaller.

1478
01:17:07,063 --> 01:17:11,435
Or even... sprout wings
capable of flight.

1479
01:17:12,769 --> 01:17:15,672
Let's go.

1480
01:17:15,706 --> 01:17:17,508
And that will mark
the end of the human race.

1481
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:19,075
Before that happens, using our

1482
01:17:19,109 --> 01:17:23,680
nuclear wisdom is the only road
to salvation for mankind.

1483
01:17:23,714 --> 01:17:25,782
Are you serious?

1484
01:17:27,183 --> 01:17:29,820
I'm not really supposed
to be sharing this info,

1485
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:32,723
but, the Defense Secretary wants to use

1486
01:17:32,756 --> 01:17:35,792
a warhead against Godzilla.

1487
01:17:35,826 --> 01:17:37,528
What'd the White House say?

1488
01:17:37,561 --> 01:17:39,963
Yes, because there's now a 13% chance

1489
01:17:39,996 --> 01:17:42,699
of Godzilla landing on the west coast.

1490
01:17:42,733 --> 01:17:45,135
The UN's ready to move, too,
and the Security Council

1491
01:17:45,168 --> 01:17:48,872
has set up a multinational strike force.

1492
01:17:48,905 --> 01:17:51,808
The US is serious.

1493
01:17:51,842 --> 01:17:55,579
Afraid so.

1494
01:17:55,612 --> 01:17:57,581
They say that to end
the threat of Godzilla,

1495
01:17:57,614 --> 01:18:00,884
a nuclear missile is the only
weapon that could kill it.

1496
01:18:00,917 --> 01:18:02,986
The missile they're
going to use is the B83

1497
01:18:03,019 --> 01:18:05,188
which is 75 times stronger than the bomb

1498
01:18:05,221 --> 01:18:08,559
that was dropped on Hiroshima!

1499
01:18:10,126 --> 01:18:12,095
They're dropping that on Tokyo?

1500
01:18:12,128 --> 01:18:14,965
Well, I was ordered to evacuate.

1501
01:18:17,033 --> 01:18:23,807
I see. So it's highly likely. Isn't it?

1502
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,542
Yes.

1503
01:18:28,745 --> 01:18:33,484
But I don't want to be here for it.

1504
01:18:33,517 --> 01:18:36,920
I won't see a third bomb...

1505
01:18:36,953 --> 01:18:40,056
dropped on the homeland
of my grandmother.

1506
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,859
She lived through the last two.

1507
01:18:45,796 --> 01:18:49,466
We have no choice. Not with
the way things are now.

1508
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:53,003
Tell them yes.

1509
01:18:53,036 --> 01:18:55,539
Certainly. We will
act accordingly that way,

1510
01:18:55,572 --> 01:18:57,708
President Ross.

1511
01:19:04,548 --> 01:19:07,250
Well, you heard it.

1512
01:19:07,283 --> 01:19:09,152
It isn't the first time

1513
01:19:09,185 --> 01:19:12,055
something crazy's been foisted on us.

1514
01:19:12,088 --> 01:19:14,925
That's for certain.

1515
01:19:16,226 --> 01:19:19,095
But this goes too far!

1516
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:21,197
I agree.

1517
01:19:21,231 --> 01:19:23,600
Get the Chief Cabinet Secretary.

1518
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:25,135
Sir.

1519
01:19:27,103 --> 01:19:28,905
A resolution has just been passed

1520
01:19:28,939 --> 01:19:31,207
by the United Nations Security Council

1521
01:19:31,241 --> 01:19:34,611
granting a US-led force

1522
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:37,047
to exterminate Gojira.

1523
01:19:38,882 --> 01:19:43,554
As party to that, and participant,

1524
01:19:43,587 --> 01:19:48,291
we must obey it, and its tenets.

1525
01:19:48,324 --> 01:19:51,127
To do that,

1526
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:54,064
the PM needs to be
vested with full powers

1527
01:19:54,097 --> 01:19:58,134
so I can authorize a nuclear strike.

1528
01:20:05,776 --> 01:20:08,745
Isn't there some other way?

1529
01:20:08,779 --> 01:20:12,515
Think of the devastation
it will cause to Tokyo.

1530
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,603
I never imagined
that I'd go down in history

1531
01:20:32,636 --> 01:20:35,639
for something such as this.

1532
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:43,246
Yaguchi, from here on out,

1533
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:49,953
Gojira comes under US-led,
UN jurisdiction.

1534
01:20:49,986 --> 01:20:54,224
Post-war Japan is a tributary state.

1535
01:20:54,257 --> 01:20:57,628
"Post-war" extends forever, huh?

1536
01:20:57,661 --> 01:20:59,830
This is a bad choice.

1537
01:21:03,967 --> 01:21:06,369
No matter how enormous Gojira is

1538
01:21:06,402 --> 01:21:10,206
I doubt it can withstand the
million-degree heat of a nuke.

1539
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,709
As a method of extermination,

1540
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:15,812
it's our only viable option right now.

1541
01:21:15,846 --> 01:21:18,782
My team and I are on the verge
of a breakthrough,

1542
01:21:18,815 --> 01:21:21,351
with our freezing method.

1543
01:21:21,384 --> 01:21:22,819
There are still too many unknowns

1544
01:21:22,853 --> 01:21:24,354
with that plan of yours.

1545
01:21:24,387 --> 01:21:27,357
Besides, multiple nations
have pledged their support

1546
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,893
to assist us with
a complete rebuilding effort,

1547
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:32,228
provided we sign on, of course.

1548
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:36,066
Despite our best efforts, we can't destroy
Gojira on our own.

1549
01:21:36,099 --> 01:21:39,035
So if this nation is to survive,

1550
01:21:39,069 --> 01:21:40,871
we have no choice but to put our fate

1551
01:21:40,904 --> 01:21:43,674
in the UN's hands.

1552
01:21:43,707 --> 01:21:45,842
You have to understand.

1553
01:21:45,876 --> 01:21:48,178
I have to look ahead, and think about

1554
01:21:48,211 --> 01:21:51,247
what's best for a post-Gojira Japan.

1555
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:53,283
Damage is limited to just three wards.

1556
01:21:53,316 --> 01:21:54,918
But if we allow this strike...

1557
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:56,920
If it happens,
that number will multiply.

1558
01:21:56,953 --> 01:21:59,422
The city's economy is
currently in a free fall.

1559
01:21:59,455 --> 01:22:00,991
Bonds and stocks are plummeting,

1560
01:22:01,024 --> 01:22:02,993
and if we can't put a stop to this soon,

1561
01:22:03,026 --> 01:22:06,362
the nation will go into default
on all of its loans.

1562
01:22:06,396 --> 01:22:08,899
For that reason, Japan needs
international funding

1563
01:22:08,932 --> 01:22:12,435
in order to survive.

1564
01:22:12,468 --> 01:22:15,171
So scrap and rebuild, huh?

1565
01:22:15,205 --> 01:22:17,273
To save Japan.

1566
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:23,346
There isn't any other way.

1567
01:22:23,379 --> 01:22:27,718
Yaguchi. This is the reality.

1568
01:22:27,751 --> 01:22:29,686
All else is just a dream.

1569
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:33,423
What? They're going to
use a thermonuclear missile?

1570
01:22:33,456 --> 01:22:35,291
And drop that thing here?

1571
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:36,927
The government just gave the UN

1572
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,394
its sanction to do so.

1573
01:22:38,428 --> 01:22:39,963
That's insane.

1574
01:22:39,996 --> 01:22:41,932
There's still so much we don't know.

1575
01:22:41,965 --> 01:22:44,467
Gojira might even be immortal.

1576
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,269
We're faced with two choices,

1577
01:22:46,302 --> 01:22:49,706
incinerate it with a nuke,
or freeze it with a drug.

1578
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:52,709
Yeah, I guess we do
have two choices here,

1579
01:22:52,743 --> 01:22:54,377
but both are bad.

1580
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:57,781
Man is more frightening
to me than Gojira.

1581
01:22:57,814 --> 01:23:00,016
If we're to do something,
we have to do it quickly.

1582
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:02,452
The UN will be giving
time for evacuation.

1583
01:23:02,485 --> 01:23:05,055
That's our window for
finishing the freezing plan.

1584
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:07,991
Okay. We got good
results on a coagulant,

1585
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:10,927
but formulating it is one thing.
Producing it's another.

1586
01:23:10,961 --> 01:23:12,796
To freeze all of Gojira's blood,

1587
01:23:12,829 --> 01:23:16,332
we've estimated we'll need
672 kiloliters of coagulant.

1588
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:18,735
I'm trying to secure
facilities for that now.

1589
01:23:18,769 --> 01:23:19,936
What if we can't?

1590
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:24,040
We have to do it!
Don't give up.

1591
01:23:24,074 --> 01:23:26,142
Our country is depending on us all.

1592
01:23:26,176 --> 01:23:27,409
Every chemical company you know.

1593
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:30,881
Contact them now, and ask them
to open every line possible!

1594
01:23:30,914 --> 01:23:32,015
You will? Thank you!

1595
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:34,417
I'm sending all
pertinent data to you right now.

1596
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:36,385
And please let everyone
know that we need production

1597
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,354
finished by tomorrow at the latest.

1598
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:40,223
Cross-checking's
complete by all the groups

1599
01:23:40,256 --> 01:23:42,158
we've reached out to.
Well, well.

1600
01:23:42,192 --> 01:23:44,260
I guess spreading knowledge works.

1601
01:23:56,506 --> 01:23:58,441
We're still working
on logistics for police

1602
01:23:58,474 --> 01:24:00,777
and MLIT to ship the coagulant.

1603
01:24:00,811 --> 01:24:03,379
I can handle that,
but I need METI to coordinate

1604
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:05,982
with the pump makers.

1605
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:08,885
Hey, I was just told that
if we agree to buy them,

1606
01:24:08,919 --> 01:24:11,187
Shanghai will get
three tanker trucks to us.

1607
01:24:11,221 --> 01:24:13,023
Any size.
Yes, that's correct.

1608
01:24:13,056 --> 01:24:15,325
We still need five more wheel loaders.

1609
01:24:19,295 --> 01:24:20,864
We have news, sir.

1610
01:24:20,897 --> 01:24:23,499
Ambassador Lansing relayed
coalition projections.

1611
01:24:23,533 --> 01:24:25,401
According to current readings,

1612
01:24:25,435 --> 01:24:27,804
Gojira's energy beam will be restored

1613
01:24:27,838 --> 01:24:31,274
to previous levels in 360 hours.

1614
01:24:32,508 --> 01:24:34,878
That means the creature
is likely to resume

1615
01:24:34,911 --> 01:24:38,181
activity again in 15 days.

1616
01:24:38,214 --> 01:24:39,282
I see.

1617
01:24:39,315 --> 01:24:41,117
A charter home will be

1618
01:24:41,151 --> 01:24:42,886
leaving in an hour.

1619
01:24:42,919 --> 01:24:44,854
All remaining staff, prepare
to leave immediately.

1620
01:24:44,855 --> 01:24:46,288
The start time for the nuclear strike

1621
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:47,924
against Godzilla has been decided.

1622
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:50,060
Countdown will begin in five minutes.

1623
01:24:50,093 --> 01:24:53,096
So, it's too late to turn back now.

1624
01:24:53,129 --> 01:24:55,398
Japan has been given
a two week grace period

1625
01:24:55,431 --> 01:24:58,501
in order to evacuate
remaining residents.

1626
01:24:58,534 --> 01:25:01,604
That may seem long
for the Allied Forces,

1627
01:25:01,637 --> 01:25:05,475
but it's too short for Japan.

1628
01:25:05,508 --> 01:25:08,511
What they ask...
that we somehow evacuate

1629
01:25:08,544 --> 01:25:13,049
millions of people from their homes...

1630
01:25:13,083 --> 01:25:15,952
is far easier said than done.

1631
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:17,187
I agree.

1632
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:19,890
But 3.6 million people?
That's insane!

1633
01:25:19,923 --> 01:25:21,992
We don't have the manpower
for a job that size!

1634
01:25:22,025 --> 01:25:23,226
What about the millions more

1635
01:25:23,259 --> 01:25:25,628
in neighboring prefectures?
What are we doing about them?

1636
01:25:25,661 --> 01:25:28,364
The governor protests
the sacrifice of Tokyo!

1637
01:25:28,398 --> 01:25:30,100
Look, this is a national decision,

1638
01:25:30,133 --> 01:25:31,968
not a municipal one, got it?

1639
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:33,970
But, sir. Relocating that many people

1640
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:36,239
in two weeks is impossible,
we can't do it.

1641
01:25:36,272 --> 01:25:38,108
For the sake of
all those people's lives,

1642
01:25:38,141 --> 01:25:40,276
you have to.
The moment Gojira stirs,

1643
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:41,945
the strike is going to be moved up,

1644
01:25:41,978 --> 01:25:44,380
and we don't want people here
when that happens.

1645
01:25:44,414 --> 01:25:47,183
Regardless of collateral damage,
a thermonuclear missile

1646
01:25:47,217 --> 01:25:49,385
will be launched from
a sub at that time.

1647
01:25:49,419 --> 01:25:52,322
As per the coalition's decision.

1648
01:25:52,355 --> 01:25:54,557
Ridiculous! It's easy for them to say

1649
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:56,559
with us in far-off Asia!

1650
01:25:56,592 --> 01:25:59,029
They told me they'd do the same

1651
01:25:59,062 --> 01:26:02,365
if Gojira would have
surfaced in New York.

1652
01:26:06,169 --> 01:26:08,304
Please proceed in an orderly fashion,

1653
01:26:08,338 --> 01:26:10,173
and if you're travelling with children,

1654
01:26:10,206 --> 01:26:15,645
please hold their hands.

1655
01:26:38,969 --> 01:26:41,037
Land prices are soaring in West Japan.

1656
01:26:41,071 --> 01:26:42,638
Food is short.

1657
01:26:42,672 --> 01:26:44,941
Kanto area shops and
businesses have all been

1658
01:26:44,975 --> 01:26:49,345
shuttered and the city's
full of the unemployed.

1659
01:26:49,379 --> 01:26:53,549
The yen's plunged, of course.
Investors are scared.

1660
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:56,052
Except those profiting from it.

1661
01:26:56,086 --> 01:27:00,456
People come in all forms.
Good and bad.

1662
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:02,458
So did you uncover anything?

1663
01:27:02,492 --> 01:27:06,262
'Course I did.
That is my job, after all.

1664
01:27:06,296 --> 01:27:09,465
I'll use it in an article I'm
hoping can be published,

1665
01:27:09,499 --> 01:27:12,602
on the day prior to the bomb drop.

1666
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:17,107
Some new Gojira material.

1667
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:21,144
In exchange, we can control
the announcement timing.

1668
01:27:21,177 --> 01:27:23,013
How's that sound?

1669
01:27:23,046 --> 01:27:25,982
It sounds very good.

1670
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:32,755
So Goro Maki hated
the radiation sickness

1671
01:27:32,788 --> 01:27:37,193
that took his wife's life with
every fiber of his being.

1672
01:27:37,227 --> 01:27:42,365
He hoped to find a way to render
radioactive materials harmless.

1673
01:27:42,398 --> 01:27:44,334
Well, if something like that
could be possible,

1674
01:27:44,367 --> 01:27:47,470
then so, too, could the creation
of new material.

1675
01:27:47,503 --> 01:27:49,772
He must've feared
the military would use it.

1676
01:27:49,805 --> 01:27:51,707
That certainly would
explain why he redacted

1677
01:27:51,741 --> 01:27:54,077
the DOE data.

1678
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:57,480
Professor Maki hated
radioactive materials.

1679
01:27:57,513 --> 01:28:02,618
And possibly even anyone or
anything who worked with them.

1680
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:07,290
And that includes Japan,
which left his wife to die.

1681
01:28:07,323 --> 01:28:09,459
But then he leaves his data
with a note that says

1682
01:28:09,492 --> 01:28:15,631
"Do as you please"?
What a strange guy.

1683
01:28:15,665 --> 01:28:19,035
But just what did Maki do in the end?

1684
01:28:27,777 --> 01:28:29,045
Thank you for this meal.

1685
01:28:29,079 --> 01:28:32,382
Agh. Hmm.

1686
01:28:32,415 --> 01:28:34,250
You solve the chart yet?

1687
01:28:34,284 --> 01:28:36,086
No, not even with
the help of a brilliant

1688
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:38,488
cryptographer who came
highly recommended.

1689
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:40,290
You hear anything from the US?

1690
01:28:40,323 --> 01:28:42,225
I don't think we can
rely on them too much.

1691
01:28:42,258 --> 01:28:43,626
Not right now.

1692
01:28:43,659 --> 01:28:45,428
We've taken a
multi-tiered approach to try

1693
01:28:45,461 --> 01:28:48,198
and decipher Maki's info,
but it's bizarre.

1694
01:28:48,231 --> 01:28:50,400
This chemical schematic
is quite confusing.

1695
01:28:50,433 --> 01:28:52,202
Resembles a mandala.

1696
01:28:52,235 --> 01:28:54,237
I've even tried working
backwards from the solution

1697
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:55,771
and still can't figure it out.

1698
01:28:55,805 --> 01:28:59,375
This Maki. Was the man insane?

1699
01:28:59,409 --> 01:29:01,744
Even I'm baffled by these lines.

1700
01:29:01,777 --> 01:29:03,346
Why'd he put it on paper

1701
01:29:03,379 --> 01:29:05,548
instead of an electronic file?

1702
01:29:05,581 --> 01:29:11,554
Perhaps... it's meant to be folded?

1703
01:29:11,587 --> 01:29:15,091
You know. With a lot of us eating now,

1704
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:17,260
it makes me wonder about Gojira there.

1705
01:29:17,293 --> 01:29:19,095
Do you think that it gets hungry?

1706
01:29:19,129 --> 01:29:20,463
No doubt.

1707
01:29:20,496 --> 01:29:21,663
Yeah, but look, the thing's got

1708
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,333
some really crooked teeth.

1709
01:29:23,366 --> 01:29:28,204
It can't even prey
on nuclear waste. Hmph.

1710
01:29:31,607 --> 01:29:34,110
Origami.

1711
01:29:35,478 --> 01:29:37,547
Huuuh...

1712
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:38,681
It's not eaten.

1713
01:29:38,714 --> 01:29:40,783
We finally
figured out the entire pattern.

1714
01:29:40,816 --> 01:29:43,119
This new information
came from making folds,

1715
01:29:43,153 --> 01:29:45,121
just like in origami.

1716
01:29:45,155 --> 01:29:46,256
What we've done is focus on

1717
01:29:46,289 --> 01:29:47,723
radiation as its energy.

1718
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:50,326
When the schematic's folded,
it's a molecular chart

1719
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,462
for converting elements in the body.

1720
01:29:52,495 --> 01:29:54,797
Gojira's body has molecules
that can do this.

1721
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:56,566
And the proof of this is in the unknown

1722
01:29:56,599 --> 01:29:59,135
radioactive isotope.
I'm sure of it!

1723
01:29:59,169 --> 01:30:00,302
The way it works is when either

1724
01:30:00,303 --> 01:30:02,338
hydrogen or nitrogen enters the body,

1725
01:30:02,372 --> 01:30:04,574
it's converted into
the necessary molecules.

1726
01:30:04,607 --> 01:30:06,809
Gojira's a mixotroph
with an organ that converts

1727
01:30:06,842 --> 01:30:09,912
decaying heat into
the energy that sustains it.

1728
01:30:09,945 --> 01:30:12,648
That's my hypothesis.
Questions?

1729
01:30:13,949 --> 01:30:15,418
It can live anywhere where there's

1730
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:19,355
water or oxygen, huh?
So basically everywhere.

1731
01:30:19,389 --> 01:30:21,257
What you're saying
is that Gojira is not only

1732
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:23,793
a threat to mankind,
but also an organism

1733
01:30:23,826 --> 01:30:26,162
that could potentially
be indestructible.

1734
01:30:26,196 --> 01:30:27,430
Is that right?

1735
01:30:27,463 --> 01:30:29,631
If the latter's true,
we have no certainty the coagulant

1736
01:30:29,632 --> 01:30:32,202
will be effective once it's
inside Gojira's body,

1737
01:30:32,235 --> 01:30:33,569
killing the Yaguchi Plan.

1738
01:30:33,603 --> 01:30:35,471
Yeah, possibly. So what now?

1739
01:30:35,505 --> 01:30:36,838
We raise the certainty of it working

1740
01:30:36,839 --> 01:30:38,474
through a series of tests.

1741
01:30:38,508 --> 01:30:39,908
Exactly, and the first thing
that we'll do

1742
01:30:39,909 --> 01:30:42,212
is analyze this structure.
Top to bottom.

1743
01:30:42,245 --> 01:30:43,645
I've already got supercomputers running

1744
01:30:43,646 --> 01:30:45,548
parallel analysis, but results are still

1745
01:30:45,581 --> 01:30:48,184
several weeks away I've been told.

1746
01:30:48,218 --> 01:30:50,486
But we only have ten days left, Yasuda.

1747
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,555
I know. That's why I've asked MEXT

1748
01:30:52,588 --> 01:30:54,757
to use their global connections.

1749
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:56,359
A call from Japan.

1750
01:30:56,392 --> 01:30:57,927
They're requesting parallel computing

1751
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,795
on info about the Gojira creature.

1752
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:01,297
Tell them we're sympathetic,

1753
01:31:01,331 --> 01:31:02,931
but there's no way we can
do that since ours is

1754
01:31:02,932 --> 01:31:05,735
a closed system, and a
proprietary one, at that.

1755
01:31:05,768 --> 01:31:08,804
We just can't risk
our data being stolen.

1756
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:11,274
Oh, come, don't be like that.

1757
01:31:11,307 --> 01:31:14,644
Have some trust in your
fellow man for once. Right?

1758
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:17,247
Please tell them that our answer is yes.

1759
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,349
We'd be happy to help them.

1760
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:33,263
Hey, we've done it!
We've solved Maki's riddle!

1761
01:31:35,265 --> 01:31:38,334
Here, look!

1762
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,270
See!

1763
01:31:41,771 --> 01:31:43,506
Incredible.

1764
01:31:43,539 --> 01:31:45,975
You see there. It's not
the cell membrane itself,

1765
01:31:46,008 --> 01:31:47,710
but an extremophile configuration

1766
01:31:47,743 --> 01:31:49,712
that inhibits cell membrane activity.

1767
01:31:49,745 --> 01:31:51,547
You understand?

1768
01:31:53,583 --> 01:31:55,885
This inhibitor could mean
the blood coagulant plan

1769
01:31:55,918 --> 01:31:59,889
is still a viable option, and
one that might actually work.

1770
01:32:01,691 --> 01:32:04,927
It looks good.

1771
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,796
Okay.

1772
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:13,803
I get the feeling Maki anticipated this.

1773
01:32:13,836 --> 01:32:16,739
Maybe he saw the arrival
of Gojira as a test.

1774
01:32:16,772 --> 01:32:23,579
One for mankind, the world,
and of course, Japan.

1775
01:32:23,613 --> 01:32:27,717
Does his "Do as you please"
include nuclear weapons?

1776
01:32:29,051 --> 01:32:32,288
Maybe so.

1777
01:32:32,322 --> 01:32:34,824
"Do as you please," right?

1778
01:32:37,026 --> 01:32:39,629
You know,

1779
01:32:39,662 --> 01:32:44,600
that's a pretty hard thing
to do in this country.

1780
01:32:44,634 --> 01:32:47,337
Yeah.

1781
01:32:47,370 --> 01:32:48,704
If you're alone.

1782
01:32:48,738 --> 01:32:50,873
Sir. I'm happy to
announce that we've managed

1783
01:32:50,906 --> 01:32:53,776
to iron out the last kinks
in the Yaguchi Plan.

1784
01:32:53,809 --> 01:32:56,846
We ask your approval to deploy it.

1785
01:32:56,879 --> 01:32:59,349
I'm sorry, Izumi,

1786
01:32:59,382 --> 01:33:03,018
but the UN resolution
has already passed.

1787
01:33:03,052 --> 01:33:05,355
Some say the US seeks a quick resolution

1788
01:33:05,388 --> 01:33:06,822
for one primary reason.

1789
01:33:06,856 --> 01:33:09,024
And that's to bury their
knowledge of Gojira.

1790
01:33:09,058 --> 01:33:12,328
Of course, and we already know that!

1791
01:33:12,362 --> 01:33:14,964
And you know the condition
that our country is in.

1792
01:33:14,997 --> 01:33:17,800
All due respect, why let other nations

1793
01:33:17,833 --> 01:33:23,072
blow our country up
when we could save it?

1794
01:33:23,105 --> 01:33:26,709
What you're saying is
the fate of our country,

1795
01:33:26,742 --> 01:33:29,779
it would be best
guided by our own hands.

1796
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:34,684
Perhaps it's time that
Japan did as it pleased.

1797
01:33:34,717 --> 01:33:37,453
Yes, you're right.

1798
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:41,657
So, my stamp.
Where do I affix it?

1799
01:33:44,059 --> 01:33:45,895
"Once the coagulate
has been administered"

1800
01:33:45,928 --> 01:33:47,897
as strategized, the blood will freeze

1801
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:51,133
"and render the creature
immobile as a result."

1802
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:54,404
Wordy, I know.

1803
01:33:54,437 --> 01:33:56,105
You have a name for this plan?

1804
01:33:56,138 --> 01:34:01,511
"Yashiori" after the legendary
saké that felled a hydra.

1805
01:34:01,544 --> 01:34:04,980
Very well. We'll run
this op in five phases.

1806
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:07,417
Akasaka worked out the details.

1807
01:34:07,450 --> 01:34:09,519
Requested vehicles
have all been prepped.

1808
01:34:09,552 --> 01:34:11,185
Plus explosives drills
have been conducted

1809
01:34:11,186 --> 01:34:13,523
and quite successfully, I might add.

1810
01:34:13,556 --> 01:34:16,692
Forces are execution-ready.

1811
01:34:16,726 --> 01:34:18,461
I owe you thanks.

1812
01:34:18,494 --> 01:34:20,162
No, you don't.

1813
01:34:20,195 --> 01:34:22,097
It's our job.

1814
01:34:31,507 --> 01:34:36,078
Just two days left on the countdown.

1815
01:34:36,111 --> 01:34:38,681
Dammit. I still need
three days in order to

1816
01:34:38,714 --> 01:34:41,083
make the amount of coagulant we need.

1817
01:34:41,116 --> 01:34:43,419
Is there any way the
countdown could be suspended?

1818
01:34:43,453 --> 01:34:44,819
Who on the Security Council could we get

1819
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:47,056
to help us stall?
Any suggestions?

1820
01:34:47,089 --> 01:34:48,858
Not China or Russia because they're too

1821
01:34:48,891 --> 01:34:50,693
geopolitically close to us.

1822
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:52,962
How about France?
Nuclear country.

1823
01:34:52,995 --> 01:34:55,197
I'm sure they'd be
interested in biology, too.

1824
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:57,433
- Yeah.
- I've got a French contact.

1825
01:34:57,467 --> 01:34:58,733
Would you like for me to reach out?

1826
01:34:58,734 --> 01:35:00,035
Yes, please.

1827
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:01,871
I'll try the Chief
of the European Bureau.

1828
01:35:01,904 --> 01:35:04,039
Do it. And I'm going to
call the Foreign Minister.

1829
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:05,908
We need 24 more hours, people!

1830
01:35:05,941 --> 01:35:07,142
Sir!

1831
01:35:07,176 --> 01:35:09,579
France has petitioned
to interrupt the countdown.

1832
01:35:09,612 --> 01:35:16,619
China and Russia are opposed,
but we're maintaining silence.

1833
01:35:16,652 --> 01:35:18,521
That's because it isn't just hardliners

1834
01:35:18,554 --> 01:35:21,891
at the nucleus of
Washington and the Pentagon.

1835
01:35:21,924 --> 01:35:23,759
Japan has grown up enough to have

1836
01:35:23,793 --> 01:35:29,131
international trade deals on the sly.

1837
01:35:29,164 --> 01:35:33,736
Danger is another opportunity
for personal growth.

1838
01:35:36,672 --> 01:35:38,107
Our friends are progressing with

1839
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:42,845
an effective deep freeze plan.

1840
01:35:42,878 --> 01:35:45,648
I think this country is betting on it.

1841
01:35:45,681 --> 01:35:48,918
And you're raising that bet also I see.

1842
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:52,555
Nuclear weapons are a deterrent.

1843
01:35:53,789 --> 01:35:56,058
I've been trying to advise
Charles against it,

1844
01:35:56,091 --> 01:36:01,196
but it goes against the flow
of the mainstream.

1845
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:05,200
And you and I must bear
the risk of retaliation.

1846
01:36:05,234 --> 01:36:07,069
Me, I'm okay.

1847
01:36:07,102 --> 01:36:10,640
But you, with your fastidious career

1848
01:36:10,673 --> 01:36:16,779
and the Patterson name, mud will stick.

1849
01:36:16,812 --> 01:36:18,748
And your dream of becoming president

1850
01:36:18,781 --> 01:36:22,084
in your forties will disappear.

1851
01:36:37,967 --> 01:36:41,737
Hey, Kayoco.

1852
01:36:41,771 --> 01:36:43,939
Good luck.

1853
01:36:43,973 --> 01:36:45,174
Yeah.

1854
01:36:45,207 --> 01:36:47,009
A joint strategy, huh?

1855
01:36:47,042 --> 01:36:48,844
Our countries can raise
the chance of success

1856
01:36:48,878 --> 01:36:49,979
by partnering up.

1857
01:36:50,012 --> 01:36:51,714
The US'll give my plan a shot?

1858
01:36:51,747 --> 01:36:53,182
Gotta admit I'm surprised.

1859
01:36:53,215 --> 01:36:55,184
Well, it helps to have me as a friend.

1860
01:36:55,217 --> 01:36:56,686
Whatever you need, I can get,

1861
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:58,253
whether it's vehicles or technology.

1862
01:36:58,287 --> 01:37:03,025
Even drones if you need them.
So, what do you say?

1863
01:37:03,058 --> 01:37:05,127
I'm in, but there is
no guarantee of them

1864
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:06,762
coming back in one piece.

1865
01:37:06,796 --> 01:37:10,232
Of course. I'll bill
the Japanese government later.

1866
01:37:18,641 --> 01:37:20,174
We were able to finish
the number of inhibitors

1867
01:37:20,175 --> 01:37:22,044
that you needed. That's right.

1868
01:37:22,077 --> 01:37:23,913
You can send over
the tankers to pick them up.

1869
01:37:23,946 --> 01:37:25,615
They're done.

1870
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:29,218
We have material and coagulant.

1871
01:37:29,251 --> 01:37:31,787
Everything will be
operation-ready in a few hours.

1872
01:37:31,821 --> 01:37:34,690
You can give HQ the green light.

1873
01:37:34,724 --> 01:37:37,326
Yaguchi. Are you sure
you won't reconsider

1874
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:39,261
accompanying the front line troops?

1875
01:37:39,294 --> 01:37:41,163
I have to be there
because a political decision

1876
01:37:41,196 --> 01:37:44,634
might be needed.
And if so, I have to make it.

1877
01:37:44,667 --> 01:37:48,003
It's still risky.
Directing from the rear's safer.

1878
01:37:48,037 --> 01:37:50,072
Don't you want to be
the PM in ten years?

1879
01:37:50,105 --> 01:37:51,974
If we're not able to pull this off,

1880
01:37:52,007 --> 01:37:54,744
there may not be a country left by then.

1881
01:37:54,777 --> 01:37:56,646
If I don't make it,
there are lots of others

1882
01:37:56,679 --> 01:37:59,248
who can take my place.
Such as you.

1883
01:37:59,281 --> 01:38:01,350
You'd make a great leader.

1884
01:38:06,922 --> 01:38:09,224
You've kept me going
through this. Thank you.

1885
01:38:09,258 --> 01:38:12,027
Don't thank me.
Thank Akasaka's mentoring.

1886
01:38:12,061 --> 01:38:13,963
Good luck.

1887
01:38:13,996 --> 01:38:17,299
Thanks. Now go save this country.

1888
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:37,753
Operation Yashiori will be dangerous!

1889
01:38:40,690 --> 01:38:43,058
The risk of radiation exposure

1890
01:38:43,092 --> 01:38:46,028
could result in both sickness and death!

1891
01:38:50,199 --> 01:38:55,104
I cannot promise that
all of you will make it back!

1892
01:38:55,137 --> 01:38:57,773
But know that your work will matter!

1893
01:39:02,111 --> 01:39:03,913
The greatest strength
that this country has

1894
01:39:03,946 --> 01:39:06,015
is you, its people!

1895
01:39:08,183 --> 01:39:12,021
The SDF. It's the last fortress
that can protect this nation,

1896
01:39:12,054 --> 01:39:14,289
and you are its soldiers!

1897
01:39:20,763 --> 01:39:25,434
The future of Japan
is now in your hands.

1898
01:39:27,502 --> 01:39:29,471
Protect it.

1899
01:39:29,504 --> 01:39:31,440
Roll out!

1900
01:39:31,473 --> 01:39:33,175
Yes, sir!

1901
01:39:33,208 --> 01:39:34,243
Weather readings were

1902
01:39:34,276 --> 01:39:36,779
just confirmed, sir.
Optimal conditions as hoped.

1903
01:39:36,812 --> 01:39:37,913
Skies are clear.

1904
01:39:37,947 --> 01:39:39,849
Northwest wind is at two meters.

1905
01:39:39,882 --> 01:39:40,950
It's holding steady and...

1906
01:39:40,983 --> 01:39:41,816
If conditions remain steady,

1907
01:39:41,817 --> 01:39:44,019
the plume should blow out to the bay

1908
01:39:44,053 --> 01:39:45,821
and minimize the impact to the city.

1909
01:39:45,855 --> 01:39:47,957
All platoons are
on the ground standing by.

1910
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:49,792
The US attack drone
squadron is in the air

1911
01:39:49,825 --> 01:39:52,795
in its designated holding pattern.
Happy to report.

1912
01:39:52,828 --> 01:39:55,464
All systems are go, Chief.
Just waiting on one thing.

1913
01:39:55,497 --> 01:39:58,968
Word from Tokyo that
the evacuation is complete.

1914
01:39:59,001 --> 01:40:02,805
We've only got one shot
at this so we can't wait.

1915
01:40:02,838 --> 01:40:04,907
Let the local governments
know we're proceeding

1916
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:06,008
and to enact curfew.

1917
01:40:06,041 --> 01:40:08,878
Roger that.
Alert Kanto area municipalities.

1918
01:40:08,911 --> 01:40:11,346
Have them issue a mandatory
curfew for all citizens!

1919
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:14,216
Indoor confinement, fifty-hour minimum!

1920
01:40:14,249 --> 01:40:15,951
Roger! And Commander,

1921
01:40:15,985 --> 01:40:18,253
we've just gotten word that
the train car detachment...

1922
01:40:18,287 --> 01:40:20,022
it's approaching the zero point!

1923
01:40:20,055 --> 01:40:22,324
Then let Operation Yashiori commence!

1924
01:40:22,357 --> 01:40:24,894
Phase 1 Diversion! Begin!

1925
01:40:42,544 --> 01:40:43,813
Success! The train blasts

1926
01:40:43,846 --> 01:40:45,347
were effective, sir!

1927
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:46,916
Proceed to Phase Two!

1928
01:40:46,949 --> 01:40:48,517
Commence with the aerial assault!

1929
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:50,285
Contacting US Forces, sir!

1930
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:52,054
Command, this is Bravo 1.

1931
01:40:52,087 --> 01:40:54,189
Target in sight, engaging.

1932
01:40:54,223 --> 01:40:57,860
Copy that.
First wave airborne. Engaging.

1933
01:41:05,868 --> 01:41:07,269
Sir! The target is discharging

1934
01:41:07,302 --> 01:41:09,104
photons from its dorsal fins!

1935
01:41:09,138 --> 01:41:10,539
Gojira's taking down the drones

1936
01:41:10,572 --> 01:41:12,441
just as we anticipated.

1937
01:41:14,043 --> 01:41:15,444
First sortie destroyed!

1938
01:41:15,477 --> 01:41:18,013
Don't stop.
We're going to wear that thing down

1939
01:41:18,047 --> 01:41:21,817
and keep it discharging
energy. Until it's spent!

1940
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:26,989
Second drone sortie destroyed.

1941
01:41:27,022 --> 01:41:29,058
Third drone sortie commencing attack!

1942
01:41:29,091 --> 01:41:29,992
Target moving to

1943
01:41:30,025 --> 01:41:31,360
predetermined coordinates.

1944
01:41:37,566 --> 01:41:39,969
Third sortie destroyed!

1945
01:41:41,436 --> 01:41:43,372
Contamination zone is growing.

1946
01:41:43,405 --> 01:41:46,141
Radiation. It's exceeding
the permitted amount.

1947
01:41:46,175 --> 01:41:48,343
If we stop now, all will be lost.

1948
01:41:48,377 --> 01:41:50,345
So continue the attack!

1949
01:42:00,956 --> 01:42:02,424
Fourth sortie destroyed!

1950
01:42:02,457 --> 01:42:04,559
Launch fifth sortie now!

1951
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:12,334
Those beams. They've stopped discharging

1952
01:42:12,367 --> 01:42:16,005
from the fins.
But something strange is happening.

1953
01:42:21,977 --> 01:42:24,246
How the hell can it do that?

1954
01:42:30,019 --> 01:42:32,421
Fifth sortie has been destroyed.

1955
01:42:33,455 --> 01:42:36,391
That thing's plume.
It's doubled in intensity!

1956
01:42:36,425 --> 01:42:38,460
Hang on. Can't stop yet.

1957
01:42:38,493 --> 01:42:40,562
Launch the sixth sortie now!

1958
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:50,639
Volume is decreasing, Commander.

1959
01:42:56,311 --> 01:42:58,247
The target's flame has just ceased!

1960
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:00,549
Luring target to Kill Point 1 complete!

1961
01:43:00,582 --> 01:43:04,053
Right! Begin Phase Three!
Stationary blasting!

1962
01:43:04,086 --> 01:43:05,420
Ignite!

1963
01:43:31,513 --> 01:43:33,448
Radiation is at expected levels.

1964
01:43:33,482 --> 01:43:35,951
Now fixing target at Kill Point 1!

1965
01:43:35,985 --> 01:43:39,421
Right. Start Phase Four. Guided blast!

1966
01:44:12,321 --> 01:44:13,522
Target is down!

1967
01:44:13,555 --> 01:44:15,324
Kill Point 1 fixing complete!

1968
01:44:15,357 --> 01:44:18,660
Launch final phase!
Deploy special crane platoon!

1969
01:44:18,693 --> 01:44:21,997
Roger! First platoon! Forward!

1970
01:44:24,299 --> 01:44:27,002
Crane Platoon One.
Hydra-Slayer One.

1971
01:44:27,036 --> 01:44:29,438
Move out! Cranes 12 to 14,

1972
01:44:29,471 --> 01:44:33,042
deploy to battle positions
behind BP2 per your orders!

1973
01:44:33,075 --> 01:44:34,576
Hydra-Slayer One, Crane 11,

1974
01:44:34,609 --> 01:44:37,179
and BP1 in deployment zone, over.

1975
01:44:37,212 --> 01:44:39,614
Crane 11, Hydra-Slayer One, copy!

1976
01:44:39,648 --> 01:44:42,551
Standby with engines ready!
Deploy outriggers!

1977
01:44:42,584 --> 01:44:46,221
Approach BP1 and when ordered,
commence injection!

1978
01:44:46,255 --> 01:44:48,257
Crane 12 and BP2 deployed.

1979
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:51,393
Hydra-Slayer One. Crane 15.
All vehicles deployed.

1980
01:44:51,426 --> 01:44:54,463
Engaging hook-up. Over.

1981
01:44:54,496 --> 01:44:57,166
Crane 15.
Hydra-Slayer One. Copy!

1982
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:00,035
Stay at outer operation range!

1983
01:45:02,304 --> 01:45:04,073
Begin the injection!

1984
01:45:04,106 --> 01:45:06,375
Injecting coagulant!

1985
01:45:08,577 --> 01:45:10,345
All pumps initiate!

1986
01:45:10,379 --> 01:45:12,114
RC is operational!

1987
01:45:12,147 --> 01:45:13,815
Okay, raise the output pressure!

1988
01:45:13,848 --> 01:45:16,785
Target the mouth as much as possible!

1989
01:45:22,157 --> 01:45:25,627
Commander, 20% of supply administered.

1990
01:45:29,798 --> 01:45:33,302
The dosage target is now exceeding 30%.

1991
01:45:41,276 --> 01:45:43,245
Crane Platoon One.

1992
01:45:43,278 --> 01:45:44,779
They're gone.

1993
01:45:57,226 --> 01:46:00,129
Dosage is working!
Look, the target's slowing down!

1994
01:46:00,162 --> 01:46:02,864
Now's our chance!
Deploy all train bombs!

1995
01:46:02,897 --> 01:46:04,733
Do it now!

1996
01:46:26,355 --> 01:46:28,223
Gojira. He's fallen!

1997
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:30,292
Then roll out
the second and third platoons!

1998
01:46:30,325 --> 01:46:32,661
Second and third platoons. Forward!

1999
01:46:32,694 --> 01:46:34,763
Freeze the bastard!

2000
01:46:56,318 --> 01:46:59,421
Do it! Administer all at once!

2001
01:47:03,925 --> 01:47:06,328
Fifty percent of supply administered!

2002
01:47:06,361 --> 01:47:08,297
The first 20 tanks are almost empty.

2003
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:12,534
Got it. Switch tanks to 21
and above! Quickly!

2004
01:47:13,935 --> 01:47:17,406
Sixty percent of supply administered!

2005
01:47:30,452 --> 01:47:32,454
Seventy-five percent of supply gone.

2006
01:47:32,487 --> 01:47:36,291
We've now passed the coagulant
minimum that was projected.

2007
01:47:39,261 --> 01:47:41,930
Ninety percent of supply administered!

2008
01:47:44,899 --> 01:47:46,501
One hundred percent used!

2009
01:47:46,535 --> 01:47:48,503
Critical point's been reached!

2010
01:47:48,537 --> 01:47:51,273
The target's skin
appears to be stiffening!

2011
01:47:51,306 --> 01:47:53,608
Please let this work.

2012
01:48:05,287 --> 01:48:07,256
Did it work?

2013
01:48:12,294 --> 01:48:14,929
Oh, no! The target has resumed activity!

2014
01:48:14,963 --> 01:48:16,998
Full evacuation now!

2015
01:48:17,031 --> 01:48:20,001
Change positions! Hurry!

2016
01:48:20,034 --> 01:48:21,670
All troops, abandon attack

2017
01:48:21,703 --> 01:48:23,838
and evacuate to the holding area!

2018
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:37,319
Chest area temperature

2019
01:48:37,352 --> 01:48:41,323
has dropped to negative 196 degrees.

2020
01:48:41,356 --> 01:48:45,594
Gojira. It's completely shut down!

2021
01:48:48,997 --> 01:48:52,801
Operation Yashiori...
Appears to be a success.

2022
01:49:01,042 --> 01:49:05,380
Thank you. All of you.

2023
01:49:12,654 --> 01:49:15,023
We were down to just under an hour,

2024
01:49:15,056 --> 01:49:17,392
which was far too close for comfort.

2025
01:49:17,426 --> 01:49:18,860
But we wouldn't have even had that

2026
01:49:18,893 --> 01:49:21,863
if the PM hadn't been able
to convince France.

2027
01:49:28,703 --> 01:49:31,440
'Scuse me!

2028
01:49:31,473 --> 01:49:33,808
Come and look at this survey data.

2029
01:49:40,849 --> 01:49:42,617
Huh.

2030
01:49:42,651 --> 01:49:46,621
Gojira's new isotope
has a half-life of 20 days.

2031
01:49:46,655 --> 01:49:48,623
And then halved again a month from now.

2032
01:49:48,657 --> 01:49:50,425
It'll be gone in two to three years.

2033
01:49:50,459 --> 01:49:53,862
Right. That's good news
for the residents of Tokyo.

2034
01:49:53,895 --> 01:49:55,764
Yeah.

2035
01:49:58,433 --> 01:50:00,569
Thank goodness.

2036
01:50:11,546 --> 01:50:14,816
Good work.

2037
01:50:14,849 --> 01:50:17,118
Yaguchi, I've been told
that the Satomi cabinet

2038
01:50:17,151 --> 01:50:20,088
will soon be resigning en masse.

2039
01:50:20,121 --> 01:50:22,824
All in line with your scenario, correct?

2040
01:50:22,857 --> 01:50:27,529
Wasn't mine.
This was all Satomi's scenario.

2041
01:50:34,503 --> 01:50:37,739
The capital and the government
are in shambles right now.

2042
01:50:37,772 --> 01:50:42,511
It's a good opportunity
to rebuild it right.

2043
01:50:42,544 --> 01:50:44,979
And speaking of which, once the relief

2044
01:50:45,013 --> 01:50:47,048
and reconstruction bills
have been passed,

2045
01:50:47,081 --> 01:50:50,819
the event that will happen
afterwards is the next election.

2046
01:50:50,852 --> 01:50:55,123
To resuscitate Japan
and its 3.6 million refugees,

2047
01:50:55,156 --> 01:50:58,527
we'll need a new leader
and a new cabinet.

2048
01:51:00,929 --> 01:51:02,764
This country was devastated before

2049
01:51:02,797 --> 01:51:04,999
but it rose from the ashes.

2050
01:51:07,536 --> 01:51:09,804
It'll do so again.

2051
01:51:32,761 --> 01:51:34,996
The countdown was only suspended.

2052
01:51:35,029 --> 01:51:38,633
But it'll restart if Godzilla
begins moving again.

2053
01:51:38,667 --> 01:51:42,971
Nuclear weapons will
be used if that happens.

2054
01:51:43,004 --> 01:51:45,974
I'm really amazed you agreed to that.

2055
01:51:46,007 --> 01:51:49,678
Well, I had to keep the world satisfied.

2056
01:51:49,711 --> 01:51:52,547
Now Japan, no...

2057
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:56,417
all mankind, must coexist with Gojira.

2058
01:51:58,052 --> 01:52:00,755
So you shared the data with France.

2059
01:52:00,789 --> 01:52:04,092
Yes, with France, and the entire world.

2060
01:52:04,125 --> 01:52:07,462
But still I regret nothing.

2061
01:52:07,496 --> 01:52:10,932
I like this "by-any-means"
approach of yours.

2062
01:52:10,965 --> 01:52:15,637
Therefore... don't quit.

2063
01:52:18,607 --> 01:52:20,575
When I'm President of the US,

2064
01:52:20,609 --> 01:52:23,244
you'd be ideal as
my Japanese counterpart.

2065
01:52:23,277 --> 01:52:27,616
Your Japanese puppet, you mean.

2066
01:52:27,649 --> 01:52:31,486
The fact remains
that casualties were high.

2067
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:35,590
And accountability comes with this job.

2068
01:52:35,624 --> 01:52:41,863
A politician must decide
whether to own it or not.

2069
01:52:41,896 --> 01:52:44,599
I myself choose to own it.

2070
01:52:47,201 --> 01:52:53,808
Well, like Maki said,
"Do as you please."

2071
01:53:07,922 --> 01:53:10,124
Hmph.

2072
01:53:10,158 --> 01:53:13,161
I guess now's not the time to quit.

2073
01:53:15,664 --> 01:53:18,166
Because things aren't settled.

2074
01:53:18,199 --> 01:53:20,535
Not yet at least.

2074
01:53:21,305 --> 01:54:21,223
